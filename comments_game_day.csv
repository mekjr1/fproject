"1","Warriors","I don't see it. How come?"
"2","Warriors","It's not like he can't get up though. Dude always gets those monster alleyoops. "
"3","Warriors","he's the top prospect in the world, I wouldn't call him under the radar"
"4","Warriors","Tim Duncan has to be one of the closest. For what Timmy does on the court, and what he means to the franchise, he doesn't really get paid that much. He's making around 10mil per year, close to Curry (11mil).

But I don't think any contract can beat the MVP for much less than the max."
"5","Warriors","So you just like basketball, like all of us"
"6","Warriors","Jordan too, no?  Kinda a lost art it seems."
"7","Warriors","Only other professional athlete like Curry now is Messi.  Every time they have the ball, I expect the impossible. Impossible is nothing. Under Armour's new campaign. "
"8","Warriors","For both teams I'd argue that they shouldn't do it. Both of these guys are proven winners in their given systems. Whereas we've barely seen anything out of Randle yet."
"9","Warriors","Tmac wasn't wasted potential though. He got really unlucky with injuries. I don't think he's comparable with Dwight at all "
"10","Warriors","Hack a Curry. New strategy. "
"11","Warriors","You could have ended up with Darko, it could have been worst.
"
"12","Warriors","Currently? Lebron. Healthy? Steph."
"13","Warriors","Makes you wonder what the game will look like in 30 years"
"14","Warriors","Westbrook over Steph, Melo, Harden, and AD? How?"
"15","Warriors","I doubt anyone thinks were even top 10. But years from now people will look back and say wow that team was the real deal. "
"16","Warriors","That's why we won executive of the year. "
"17","Warriors","Take David Lee and the rights to your 2016 1st and we'll talk. Only because AD will be a FA and signing him would put us over the top. "
"18","Warriors","That's not how that works just because you play better in the latter half of the season doesn't mean you would've been on fire in the first half. I say easily because without Lebron they would still make the playoffs. Without Curry the Warriors would be fighting for the 8th spot. "
"19","Warriors","Klay Thompson was 3rd team All-NBA, and he's a push with Iman Shumpert?  I think Shump's a fine player but this is silly."
"20","Warriors","Lol you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. Anytime his defender falls asleep, Bogues immediately rim runs and will get the oop from Steph. And yes, I watched Warriors all season, you condescending ignoramus. Go mope in /r/rockets. 

Edit: Here's a fucking list.

That enough for you? 
"
"21","Warriors","We deserve some sunshine. There have been some dark years (decades)."
"22","Warriors","CURRY AGAIN!!!"
"23","Warriors","The king in the West"
"24","Warriors","exceot he makes them more than anyone else"
"25","Warriors","we are talking now not a few years down the road"
"26","Warriors","Not always. Even when they did draft well the place was like a prison that players were waiting to get out of. Only recently that started to change. "
"27","Warriors","Dude, I just got tired of copy pasting after a few links into the 2nd page of results. This past season, Bogut got an oop like every other game. "
"28","Warriors","Hey, just because I'm a pot doesn't mean he's not a kettle."
"29","Warriors","[Steph Curry](http://i.imgur.com/rOr8bdx.jpg) dominates the Rockets in Game 3 dropping 40 points on 7 of 9 from deep, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, 2 steals, and a block."
"30","Warriors","Ayyy?"
"31","Warriors","For sure. It was a revolving door of coaches for a looooong time. The ownership change was huge. Before that I felt like most of the coaches wanted out as much as the players. The whole system top to bottom was poison for years. "
"32","Warriors","Of course lol. Probably max him too. "
"33","Warriors","Current word is he's staying, period. With how he's playing in the playoffs I don't see that changing."
"34","Warriors","NYC sets aside on average a million dollars per officer per year for insurance purposes in police brutality suits."
"35","Warriors","Hard to write articles when there is no ""news"".  Right now the big players that know anything--NYPD, Players Union, NBA, and the Hawks--have zero incentive to leak anything.  News cycle after new cycle about police use of excessive force takes is not in any of the big players' interest.  

What's in Thabo's interest is the interesting question.  He has a lot of cards to play and if he wanted to tell his story all over the place he could.  But he's not, and whether that's his personality, the advise he's getting, or the fact that he's been promised a huge pay-off from someone, is all unknown.  "
"36","Warriors","Runner up DPOY, 1st team all defense, gives rebounds, assists, points, whatever you need on a given night. Guards about every position. I think he's getting it.

Edit: No snark intended there."
"37","Warriors","Didn't look very professional.  
"
"38","Warriors","Ya man, crazy how many people don't realize the warriors have been playing at this incredible level all season. According to 538.com they are the fourth best team of all time statistically, but LeBron is somehow going to trump great team basketball (You know, like he did last year)"
"39","Warriors","Melo isn't bad on defense, he's average, but he's still a top 3 scorer."
"40","Warriors","Called him Seth by accident. "
"41","Warriors","That also speaks to why Barnes has had such a high corner 3% this season. He is mostly just waiting to hit it."
"42","Warriors","I thought it was showing only Curry and how he evolved throughout the season. From playing poised and controlled to playing completely bat shit insane. "
"43","Warriors","Woah Woah woah"
"44","Warriors","I know. "
"45","Warriors","Who the hell talking about letting him walk? Pretty much everyone I've seen across reddit RealGM etc says retain him at all costs. Sure we'd like not to max him but thems the breaks. "
"46","Warriors","That's a huge drop. "
"47","Warriors","Zero chance, it's not in my DNA.
But back in the day I enjoyed seeing the Bulls succeed in the Jordan era, because he deserved it and frankly like many...my favorite player of all time.

But I can see why people root for their hometown players on different teams.
From my point of view I can see why some Hornet fans and Detroit fans root for the Dubs (Draymond and Curry)."
"48","Warriors","Is that stat that crazy? You have to look beyond the stats and see what they actually mean. If they don't mean anything then yeah their egregious  but this is basically saying They're the only two guys who scored a ton, especially from 3, at a high percentage. "
"49","Warriors","That was before Ros Gold-Onwude"
"50","Warriors","Well yeah but the perfection is why they posted the stat. "
"51","Warriors","Me personally? Maybe Jordan. Or Steph shooting a J although that's homer af."
"52","Warriors","Nah, we only complain that the team's gone cold when they miss open shots, and by definition those can't have anything to do with the other team's defense. The Rockets win yesterday was in large part due to guys like Terry and Ariza not hitting open threes."
"53","Warriors","Harden stir"
"54","Warriors","Oh c'mon. It has nothing to do with the people who died on the Challenger. It was a Rockets-related joke. Obviously nobody is making fun of the deaths. The only link is that it's a rocket. People get offended at every fucking little thing these days, it's absurd.

Edit: Downvote me all you want fuckfaces."
"55","Warriors","Warriors in 7.  I'd probably pick the cavs with a healthy Love.  The warriors second unit will probably open leads against the cavs, and LeBron will have to expend tons of energy just to erase the deficit.  I see the warriors wearing him down with their team defense.

Kyrie's health is also a big factor.  If the cavs have any chance of winning, it is going to require a monster performance from Kyrie."
"56","Warriors","What"
"57","Warriors","Wut. "
"58","Warriors","Rondo Harden Lebron Draymond Howard"
"59","Warriors","He did but it's nothing that doesn't happen in oh say nearly every contested rebound ever. "
"60","Warriors","Look at it frame by frame. Curry is boxing him out and Dwight goes up under his arm. Nowhere for Currys arms to go."
"61","Warriors","Frosty root beer float ftw. "
"62","Warriors","Eh I can see how it's taunting but I don't think you can call a tech on somebody for effectively saying good call ref. "
"63","Warriors","Dwight moved his arms up while curry was boxing him out... He came up from underneath. Off Currys arms will be there."
"64","Warriors","Are those over a career cause Demarre shouldn't be judged this year on his stats from last.  Dude's changed."
"65","Warriors","&gt; You can't report if you don't know what happened

Are you being serious? ESPN reports on stories when they don't have all the information all the time. Any report on Deflategate before the Well's report falls directly under ""reporting what you don't know""."
"66","Warriors","Just a warning, this is about to get real cocky. I think the Warriors are better than last year's Spurs and the Cavs are worse than last year's Heat. Dubs in 5."
"67","Warriors","The thing is certain people can stop certain parts of his game but he's so complete it doesn't matter.

I think it's more specific in that he's one of the ones that can keep him from driving into the paint so much which is REALLY what kills you with LBJ.  But good luck stopping someone that explosive that weighs over 250, I mean part of it is just physics and most not being physically strong enough to stop his inertia."
"68","Warriors","&gt; There's not enough evidence or clarity to make a hot take about it.

TBF, that hasn't stopped the media from chiming in on previous cases of police brutality that didn't involve professional athletes."
"69","Warriors","FUCK JJ REDDICK"
"70","Warriors","People don't feel sympathy for rich athletes.  In a way it's ironic cause it doesn't matter if you're black or white, but if you're rich and famous you'll get no sympathy from people usually."
"71","Warriors","Didn't you hear JVG? He can start on multiple teams"
"72","Warriors","zero chance "
"73","Warriors","Lebron can beat us by himself.  Did you watch the last regular
Season game ? Dude is nanas "
"74","Warriors","Well, the max for a guy on his first non-rookie deal isn't a regular max, and the cap is about to skyrocket."
"75","Warriors","What does advanced metrics have to do with a rebound? A rebound is a rebound
"
"76","Warriors","Honestly, I think this is going to be an offseason story, because
   
1. The playoffs are the big story right now (the offseason is when you want extra juice for ratings)  
2. Everybody's waiting until the Hawks season ends to file in court  

I was talking with friend whose family was part of the Hawks last ownership group, and he agreed that the Hawks are waiting to see how far they go in the playoffs so they can assess damages.  I'm guessing Thabo's lawyers and the NBAPA are doing the same.

I think we're going to see the shit hit the fan once the season ends, mainly because once they file, the parties involved and their lawyers will be leaking discovery info and battling in the media to negotiate the settlement.  

The only way I don't see this becoming a thing is if the NYPD pays out an outsize amount of money to make this go away quietly.  But I don't see this happening because of the sheer size of the damages involved."
"77","Warriors","Talk about a vastly underrated view.  MJ may have stocked the fridge, but Kerr, Adams and Gentry brought some recipes into the kitchen.  The ingredients were all there, but ..... fuck it, I've taken the Food Channel metaphor as far as I can."
"78","Warriors","Haha I was making fun of a post where some dude asked that, and everybody answered like ""I'm not even gonna look that up, but yes"""
"79","Warriors","Epic response man"
"80","Warriors","LOL, wow poor KD. He won't be da real MVP after that. Thanks for explaining :)"
"81","Warriors","There was huge silence from half of Buffalo Wild Wings while the other side went crazy in amazement of that shot. "
"82","Warriors","100%. I wasn't jumping up and down about it- I definitely had concerns on how it would affect chemistry and who we would get to replace him. And full disclosure, I had no idea about Kerr. I was just crossing my fingers.

But I knew about a lot of Jacksons' deficiencies just by watching 70+ games last year. He went to the post-up too much with bad post-up guys. His offense was stale. He developed some players but let guys like HB and Iguodala underperform constantly.

So when we fired him, I was both happy and knew it was the right move, and worried for the future."
"83","Warriors","the depth of the team has allowed them to stack huge leads and gave each player time to rest A LOT during each game all year. 

That plays a huge part in this"
"84","Warriors","Not in the NBA currently but Javale McGee!"
"85","Warriors","Just for UA? I read he makes about $10M for all his endorsements"
"86","Warriors","Drays max is 15.8. Not a big deal. "
"87","Warriors","He's pur #2 right now....."
"88","Warriors","2 spooky 4 me"
"89","Warriors","I mean yeah this is the primary reason. "
"90","Warriors","If everyone was healthy we'd be in the exact same place. "
"91","Warriors","damn that analogy's on point tho"
"92","Warriors","To add to what other people are saying, he would've had a real shot at ROY outside of Tyreke looking like the next LeBron. He wasn't playing nearly as well as Reke but he was good."
"93","Warriors","Adrenaline"
"94","Warriors","I have a bunch of signed Warriors memorabilia (jerseys, t shirts, pictures, etc) but the quirkiest item I have is a Mark Jackson bobblehead signed by... Klay Thompson. No, that's not a typo.

In December of 2013 I went to a Warriors vs Pelicans game at Oracle Arena. It was ""Mark Jackson bobblehead night"", so I got a MJax bobblehead that that day. After the game, if you wait outside of the player parking lot at Oracle Arena, you can sometimes get player autographs if they stop to sign as they're driving out of the stadium. 

Klay stopped to sign autographs that day, and when he rolled down his window, he was like ""does anyone have something I could use to sign?"" So I gladly handed Klay my sharpie, as well as my bobblehead so that he had a surface to sign on. After Klay was done signing, he asked who the bobblehead/sharpie belonged to, and I said they were mine. He looked at me and was like ""thanks man!"". He was about to hand them back to me, but then he was like ""hold on, want me to sign this for you?"". Before I could even respond, Klay had autographed my Mark Jackson bobblehead lol. It was pretty awesome"
"95","Warriors","Who could they get in FA who can score like Melo other than KD?"
"96","Warriors","Agreed, I'd say his rookie year was right on par with Damian Lillard's (arguably even better), who won ROY in 2013"
"97","Warriors","&gt; Unfortunately it looks like this hit /r/all

not sure why the publicity is bad...."
"98","Warriors","I've seen every game possible since I was a kid. Endured multiple sub-20 win seasons. Making it to Western Conference Finals is already a championship."
"99","Warriors","Yeah man.  It seems like the circular mop is not as absorbent. "
"100","Warriors","&gt;I was able to connect with **Rob King, ESPN's Senior vice president,** overseeing SportsCenter, for comment. He e-mailed me the following: ""The suggestion that there has been a broader decision to spike the story is ludicrous and disappointing. We understand with great clarity the potential significance of this story and continue to report it. **As for ‘discussing it more on SportsCenter,' this is a story that deserves greater illumination, which means information, not mere discussion.** That takes reporting, and that's how we're proceeding.""

Oh, I didn't know that ESPN did any actual reporting. I thought they just talked about Riley Curry and how Tim Tebow should be relevant again lmao"
"101","Warriors","He's got elite scoring for at least 3 years maybe 4. And yeah obviously you'd have to sign other people but I'd bet he'd be a great start for a competitor."
"102","Warriors","So a guy that averaged 8.5 &amp; 8 during the season is worth 4/60?!

That's crazy talk"
"103","Warriors","Last night the Warriors played close to perfect basketball. They're close to the Spurs its just fueled by Curry's ridiculous shot making. "
"104","Warriors","I guess I kinda lost track of what you meant line to line. "
"105","Warriors","Well the Heat-Spurs series had their players healthy. It probably won't be as close as the 2013 finals just because the Cavs were hit with multiple injuries, but it'll still be fun watching the Warriors play D and Run and LeBron doing LeBron. "
"106","Warriors","We haven't won shit in 40 years. We might as well be the Royals."
"107","Warriors","I guess there is a reason it's last.  :p"
"108","Warriors","Bothers me how every four shots they show, they cut them all off and only show one going in. My OCD kicked in. "
"109","Warriors","That's a cop out.  Patrick Beverly is physically way more capable.  Uncontested threes are mental lapses.   IiRC uncontested is defined by 6 feet of space.  6 fucking feet !!!! This isn't a difference in physical defensive prowess this is a difference in paying attention.  "
"110","Warriors","that stuff gets downvoted so fast though i wouldn't have seen any of it unless you posted that tho"
"111","Warriors","Playoffs"
"112","Warriors","Stephen ""You Can't Even Do That In NBA 2K"" Curry."
"113","Warriors","It was so cringe having to watch green bite on what seemed like EVERY damn pump fake during the finals."
"114","Warriors","I'm saying we would win in 6 or 7 regardless. You really think Pat Bev would shift a sweep towards the Rockets winning? Maybe he's the real MVP.


At the end of the day it'd be Dubs Cavs. "
"115","Warriors","In Curry's defense, the first round was four games this year. "
"116","Warriors","Straaaaange Magic "
"117","Warriors","Nah VC got that"
"118","Warriors","He also costs a shit ton of money that they could use for a free agent"
"119","Warriors","I'm still super salty about the refs in that game"
"120","Warriors","Pat was healthy against us during the season too and didn't do much."
"121","Warriors","Steve Kerr - ""Will you stat monkeys please shut the fuck up?  Your giving away my secrets"""
"122","Warriors","Lowry was straight garbage in the playoffs. "
"123","Warriors","I completely agree. Rockets totally deserve to be in the WCF, and were very good in the first two games against the Warriors despite the two close losses. Harden really impressed me in those two games too, even though in general I hate his style of play (flops, drawing contact, etc.). Unfortunately for the rockets they just don't match up well against the warriors."
"124","Warriors","I mean, it was Ray Allen. "
"125","Warriors","we executed well, we just missed some shots. "
"126","Warriors","The problem is that the Warriors took a page out of the Spurs' book and just let Tony Allen be free on the three line and packed the paint. Once they did that (Barnes and Green on their bigs, Bogut with the help), Memphis couldn't score anything as long as Tony Allen was on the court. All of a sudden, both teams had a defensive answer for the other, and it became a contest of firepower, only with the Warriors having a huge edge since they don't suck in transition.

This is how the Spurs repeatedly beat down the Grizzlies. Until Memphis gets a top notch perimeter defender who can also shoot threes they won't have an answer to that strategy. Tony Allen only works on the court against teams that have 2 or fewer three point shooters or that can't pack the paint - the Warriors have 4 (including Barnes and Green), and can pack it wonderfully if there's an offensive black hole like Allen on the court."
"127","Warriors","We don't need or want him."
"128","Warriors","Yup and then he gave up the lob to Bogut right after"
"129","Warriors","Sinker of Threes and Brother of Splashes"
"130","Warriors","/r/nba, where a guy can comeback from major injuries and has rehabbed through three knee surgeries that would've ended most playerss careers = overrated. 

Motherfuckers would be walking with a cane just to get to sit in a cubicle at work, but here's D-Rose playing in the NBA and still producing. No respect."
"131","Warriors","When was the last time anyone got injured on a fast break dunk with no D? I don't think that had any impact on him not throwing it down. "
"132","Warriors","""GUYS HE SHOOTS 71 PERCENT!""

No one said this? Are you sure? I remember that little circle jerk."
"133","Warriors","Kevin Love"
"134","Warriors","Most 3s in a finals hopefully. "
"135","Warriors","He torched Beverley too in the regular season. Maybe he's just good?"
"136","Warriors","Seriously. It was so hard to talk about this team all year without sounding like a huge homer. It's just been amazing to watch. "
"137","Warriors","Most 3s in a game is the one I want him to get. The system he plays in isn't really the type that supports shooting that many but I think during a regular season game he could probably do it if Kerr doesn't bench him in the 4th. 


The problem is he'll always be benched in the 4th during the regular season and in the playoffs he probably won't shoot that many 3s. "
"138","Warriors","Remember when JVG was blowing him during the telecast, ""Terry has been great on defense because of his competitive spirit""

No, JVG. He's been totally awful in every way on both ends of the floor. "
"139","Warriors","This isn't the entirety of the events of the night, so I don't explain it beyond it had to have happened in another point in time."
"140","Warriors","Goes "
"141","Warriors","No, a NBA player is missing the playoffs because they refused to obey a lawful police order and resisted a lawful police action. "
"142","Warriors","Except baton on human doesn't sound metallic and doesn't click. That's not bias, that's fact."
"143","Warriors","Nobody's calling him a bad human being, or taking away from how hard it is to come back. He's just not a particularly above-average PG anymore."
"144","Warriors","He's resisting in the video. That's why there are 6 guys trying to get him down. That's why an officer pulls out his baton."
"145","Warriors","Exposed but lost games 1 and 2 by a combined 5 points this isn't the ncaa tournament the best team advances so shut the fuck up "
"146","Warriors","They could have taken 0 or 1 or 2 or 3or 4, but there's no way to know becasue they couldn't take 4 from the Rockets. "
"147","Warriors","If you play like absolute garbage every other game, you will average out to an average player. Confirmation bias is literally the only reason he's so overrated, because people remember the good games and just forget that the bad games ever happened."
"148","Warriors","He is absolutely resisting. It wouldn't take 6 guys pulling him around to get him down if he was not resisting. It wasn't swinging punching kicking kind of resisting, it was muscle tensing stubborn toddler kind of resisting. "
"149","Warriors","Any team that signs him as an offensive center piece is a fucking moron, and I don't think any GM is that stupid."
"150","Warriors","it's great that so many people know how a hypothetical W's/Clips series would have gone, so I don't have to wonder. thanks. "
"151","Warriors","I think you're getting it a little reversed. Dray's ability to guard anyone 1-5 positions is literally the reason we can run the defense we run. "
"152","Warriors","We haven't won a title in 40 years. It won't exactly be whispers and polite golf-clapping if the Dubs clinch in Oracle."
"153","Warriors","Because there is no Lebron-following bandwagon either?"
"154","Warriors","Your a wizard Duncan. "
"155","Warriors","Why?"
"156","Warriors","Couldn't agree more. They were fun as hell to watch "
"157","Warriors","repeat this season several more years? this has really only been his first, possibly second, ""elite"" season. Paul has been playing at top PG level for over 5 years now. 

"
"158","Warriors","Lebron will go into beast mode. However Harden was also a monster in games 1 and 2 and Anthony Davis went wild in the Pelicans series. I like our chances in 6"
"159","Warriors","On the contrary, the Western conference playoffs were full of very good teams this year, and the W's dominated during the regular season in that great conference as well.  "
"160","Warriors","And the Warriors could of drafted Kobe. But instead we got Todd Fuller"
"161","Warriors","Well he's actually shooting way more threes in the regular season. If it happens, it would have to happen during a regular season game. I mean, he hit 10 against the Mavs this seasons and the record is 12. It could definitely happen when he gets hot, but you're right that the stars would have to align with him not only being ridiculously hot, but also the game being competitive."
"162","Warriors","Distractits"
"163","Warriors","Man I want Bogut to have a ring so badly. So many fans/people connected to the team flipped out when we traded away Monta for him."
"164","Warriors","But can he do it 4 times in a seven game series?  Lebron is a beast, but we've been dealing with game breaking players almost the whole playoffs.  The Cavs haven't had to go through with a bona fide superstar yet (sorry bulls fans)."
"165","Warriors","What are you prepared to give him?"
"166","Warriors","win the mvp"
"167","Warriors","Whatever happened outside of this video is beyond the scope of this discussion (if we're to be factual), but in this video Thabo is doing something. He's passively resisting the officers direction escalating things to the point where 6 guys or whatever need to take him down and a guy needed to extend his baton. Why they felt the need to do that is beyond me but this is one 90 second moment in an evening. "
"168","Warriors","i agree"
"169","Warriors","He was failing to comply with the officer's direction to get down. And at that point he was detained, not arrested. "
"170","Warriors","bruh/breh/brah"
"171","Warriors","If Durant is healthy for the season, OKC definitely finishes above the 8 seed (more realistically in the top half of the Western Playoff picture) and then there is no telling what happens, but the Thunder definitely take the first round. I'm thinking that they bump the LAC down a spot and take the 3rd seed. Maybe/maybe not beat the Rockets in the semis?"
"172","Warriors","Nothing"
"173","Warriors","&gt; lebron never been the highest paid player on his team which i consider a bargain for what he brings to the table.

That's insane, but isn't he the highest paid player on the Cavs this season?"
"174","Warriors","He's a bit overrated because he's marketed so heavily, but I'd say he's an above average shooter who had a bad shooting season this year due to injury. He's much more efficient than Monta"
"175","Warriors","Musselman....."
"176","Warriors","I agree. I don't think Detroit should necessarily pay the max (that's the only other place I can envision him going b/c he's a Michigan boy) because he won't be able to carry that team. But I also think that he's irreplaceable on the Warriors. If you look at the teams numbers with him on the court vs off the court it's absolutely insane."
"177","Warriors","I'm pretty sure it was just a clip from the movie. Hence Tim Duncan being voiced by Brad Pitt and Popovich being voiced by Kate Blanchett."
"178","Warriors","No, he specifically said Terry had been playing good defense and it was because of his competitive spirit. He was wrong."
"179","Warriors","You think WB is better than Curry and CP3?"
"180","Warriors","you're right. With the injuries the Cavs are facing, I don't see it going past 5 or 6 games. Danny Green broke it in the 6th game I think. "
"181","Warriors","Efficiency. Defensive attention. Defense. "
"182","Warriors","The GOAT"
"183","Warriors","That"
"184","Warriors","Steph this postseason: 30/5/7 on 63% true shooting. The only disappointing part is his relatively ""awful"" free throw shooting of 82%."
"185","Warriors","Not really, but the baton is extended at Thabo's head. It's (imo) more likely the injury occurred either in a scuffle to detain him or not in this video at all."
"186","Warriors","Well...opinions and all that. "
"187","Warriors","Lol"
"188","Warriors","He's absolutely resisting. If he wasn't resisting one officer could have moved all necessary limbs without _resistance_"
"189","Warriors","I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often. Anyone want to put together a montage? "
"190","Warriors","L O L"
"191","Warriors","WE LOVE YOU LIL B! WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!"
"192","Warriors","They seriously don't let you walk if you miss rehearsal? We just got in alphabetical order and sat where they told us to. Then you go up when they call you and get your diploma. "
"193","Warriors","Just bought a WiiU and in loving it."
"194","Warriors","And now you're just overhyping him. Most athletic 7 footer? Did people like Shaq and Yao Ming just cease to exist?"
"195","Warriors","35 points in a must win game on your home floor in the WCF....how do YOU explain that?"
"196","Warriors","Russ is the most overrated defender in the modern day NBA. I have no idea where the concept of him being a good defender comes from. He gambles on defense more than any top tier player in the modern day. "
"197","Warriors","Oh hell no mindset or not if they believe you're a person of interest (for whatever reason) and you appear to be fleeing the scene you're going to get flagged down.

Thabo shouldn't have been at the club at all, imo."
"198","Warriors","The Hawks were one of the worst rebounding teams this season. That's like saying a team beats the T-Wolves this year means that they have a good chance of beating the best team in the league. The Warriors also have their fair share of people who can chase down rebounds and control the boards as well (see: Steph Curry Boxing Dwight Howard out). 

I'm not trying to downplay anything the Cavs are doing. They're playing great basketball, especially with two of their top three players out. But there's also context for everything. Pau and Noah were both injured, and we all know that at most 3 of the 4 Hawks all-stars were actually 'stars' in this league (not gonna say names). "
"199","Warriors","I think he handles trap really well. In fact he's kinda notorious for handling them well with that Davidson game. I've seen him pass out of double teams and the dubs score an easy bucket sooooo many times. "
"200","Warriors","It was extending, it came into contact with nothing except the other pieces of metal inside the baton. "
"201","Warriors","Shit you know what I actually spelled it out like that at first just out of instinct but then I decided it looked dumb and I had better just spell it with a K like everyone else does"
"202","Warriors","I ship it"
"203","Warriors","Of all time or right now? "
"204","Warriors","They were pretty awesome, regardless. Putting Pau and Kobe together worked out amazingly well."
"205","Warriors","I'm actually 83 years old so the joke's on you "
"206","Warriors","I understand, except that player was Jordan for me. "
"207","Warriors","Are you on a mission to ""set the record straight"" everywhere this clean and embarrassing boxout gets posted?"
"208","Warriors","Well I'd say Steph is a good defender. He has lapses and he's definitely not elite but he can definitely defend well enough. The stats and eye test say so at least. "
"209","Warriors","GOAT Johnny Flynn"
"210","Warriors","Is it just me or is his greatness this post-season being underappreciated? I'm not sure why but maybe its because he doesn't have the same physically and psychologically dominating personalities of a Kobe/LeBron/MJ/Durant. Maybe makes the Duncan comparison that Kerr made even more apt. The greatness is clearly there it's just so quiet that people don't give it as much credit as it deserves"
"211","Warriors","Even though some NY teams have been successful in the last 10 years (Giants, Yankees) that success is usually the worst possible scenario for fans of the other team (Jets, Mets). I'm not complaining, but after moving to the Chicagoland area I'm a little jealous of how the whole city can rally behind the Bulls or Blackhawks. When the Giants won their Superbowls it seemed like every Jets fan in the area was on a mission to make sure that everyone was miserable like themselves."
"212","Warriors","He'll never be that good. "
"213","Warriors","Lol"
"214","Warriors","Currys defense is on the up-and-up. The man used to be a liability now he's not a bad defensive pest."
"215","Warriors","He can dunk, just not an NBA standard dunk. "
"216","Warriors","Westbrook"
"217","Warriors","Klay Thompson. "
"218","Warriors","Russ is the better scorer and rebounder hands down. I feel like Russ tries to run the show too often. He had a great season minus Durant this year but when Durant is healthy Russ sometimes doesn't know when to step back and let KD play his hot hand. Just an opinion."
"219","Warriors","There's two types of bad defenders:

those who just don't have the physical tools to do so (Kevin Love, J.J. Redick, David Lee) and thus have a cap at how good they can impact the game defensively 


then there's those who just don't understand the defensive angles, fall asleep, don't try hard, etc. (James Harden's ball watching days, Kyrie, Harrison Barnes's first year) 


so I'm not sure which category Jahlil fits in, especially since it's different from being a big-man and wing defender. Two guys I know really well are Klay Thompson and Andrew Bogut. I never watched Andrew Bogut early in his career, but from what I hear he was mostly an offensive oriented center and didn't play D all that well. Now he's become one of the best, if not the best, defensive 5 in the game. So I'm sure Jahlil can improve if he puts work into it, especially since he has size, but I'm not sure how much potential he has to become great. "
"220","Warriors","A Chris Paul/Steph Curry dunk contest would be adorable."
"221","Warriors","Good luck trying to fight through 6 screens on every possession. The Cavs are gonna have to switch, but unlike Houston, they have the personnel for it."
"222","Warriors","so you mean right now? "
"223","Warriors","Sure if he leads the Warriors to a multi year dynasty we can talk. "
"224","Warriors","still runs the risk of getting injured. Just don't play if you don't need to. "
"225","Warriors","[Assert dominance, one 3 at a time...](https://youtu.be/UH5Wwnw1qXg?t=25s)"
"226","Warriors","Like... all the time."
"227","Warriors","Man, what a horrible time to get injured like that. I really hope it's not chronic. "
"228","Warriors","Maybe in this series but I've seen him do it well all season."
"229","Warriors","Yeah"
"230","Warriors","Warriors in 4 or 5.  Lebron is a beast, but the Warriors have already gone though two series with MVP caliber players (AD and Harden) going nuts, without dropping a single game in either so far.  As a team, the Cavs don't have the depth, defensive backcourt, or front line of Memphis either.

On the other hand, the Cavs haven't had to deal with a single game breaking player yet.  Don't let Lebron running through the bottom half of the Hawks roster fool you.  It's going to be beat down - Cavs/Spurs all over again."
"231","Warriors","That player is Westbrook for me"
"232","Warriors","Can you name someone who is actually a below average defender who people think is very good?"
"233","Warriors","reggie evans"
"234","Warriors","It's tensing your muscles and _resisting_ movement of your limbs versus punching, kicking etc. It's not completely passive but for the sake of comparison it fits. Furthermore, pushing and shoving an officer's arm out of the way will escalate matters."
"235","Warriors","Yep. NBA no have salary arbitration. "
"236","Warriors","No. There can only be one. "
"237","Warriors","He'll have to do what he's doing into his kid-late thirties before he can be seen as better than Jerry West or John Stockton. I feel like he'll never be on Magics Level because of size and athleticism alone, the guy was a LBJ or KD caliber athlete at the PG position. That said, he's still improving. His three point shot and handles are among the best in the league, but his defense has improved immensely and there's no saying what could happen to it next year. He plays with a high basketball IQ and is pretty damn clutch. He won't be the best of all time, but I do believe that once CP3 starts his decline, the leagues best PG is Currys title to own."
"238","Warriors","I have gained more respect for Duncan this year than I thought I would and I already respected him a ton. "
"239","Warriors","What does that have to do with anything?"
"240","Warriors","He's also older than Russ"
"241","Warriors","Trap god?"
"242","Warriors","But if you were the better team.....you would've won,.."
"243","Warriors","He's a UFA next year, I wonder how much MIA is going to throw at him? With Dragic also likely to test the market, Riley's gonna have a stressful summer."
"244","Warriors","Peolel are sleeping on Mudiay its kind of insulting at this point. "
"245","Warriors","Harden has been a monster this series. Unfortunately, so has Curry. Also the Rockets gave up last night."
"246","Warriors","Also a reminder that this team was built on tanking. Also a testament to player development and the coaching staff."
"247","Warriors","I still like my Warriors in that matchup, but i think Durant and Russ take at least one of those first two games at Oracle."
"248","Warriors","[Tony Parker](http://www.google.fr/imgres?imgurl=http://lebuzz.eurosport.fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/09/Capture11-1170x658.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://lebuzz.eurosport.fr/people/tony-parker-comme-logo-nba-pour-remplacer-jerry-west-8809/&amp;h=658&amp;w=1170&amp;tbnid=6gzk-k1vN9x1RM:&amp;zoom=1&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=160&amp;usg=__o0KiPnH-5LcAOkedx06GmzS7gIk=&amp;docid=tRNf474SNP9hHM) "
"249","Warriors","And this is why /r/nba is one of my favorite subreddits of all time. Top comment is some lighthearted humor when it could've (and has been - at least in other sport subreddits) a shit fest."
"250","Warriors","You gonna let his talk about your mom like that"
"251","Warriors","&gt;it was not a lawful police action that he resisted.

LOL.  Please come back to reality.

Amazing how people who follow the law and obey a lawful police order don't end up with broken bones.  ***shocking*** I know."
"252","Warriors","steph's dick himself is 160 lbs"
"253","Warriors","You can't just say that. Every game is different. "
"254","Warriors","He can't jump if you realize it.  Curry boxes him out and pretty much anchors himself on his quads and puts him off balance a bit.  No way your gonna be jumping through that without a called on you"
"255","Warriors","I remember ESPN making a joke about GSW just repeating history by giving Curry so much, then talking about how in retrospect Ty Lawson's $48M deal signed a few days before was an absolute bargain. "
"256","Warriors","I know, I was just making a point that Curry had a very good rookie year, even comparable to some of the better ROY winners in recent history, like Lillard"
"257","Warriors","Playing Small Ball with Steph, Kobe, Klay, Barnes and Green would be insane."
"258","Warriors","Time he gets the recognition he deserves. 

He really is the new LeBron... I mean ring wise, he's getting a ring this year, and only one more and he's tied with LeBron. 

NBA is the baby face assassin show.

"
"259","Warriors","I would wonder how that locker room would work though. If Kobe realizes that he is a leader on the team but not THE leader, it goes well."
"260","Warriors","IN. YO. FAAACE."
"261","Warriors","With those awards/honors, I wonder what his qualified max will be...especially since it falls after the huge rise in salary cap circa new tv deal and renegotiation of current CBA."
"262","Warriors","Ok. Ball movement &gt; iso because ball is lighter than players -&gt; higher speed -&gt; more open shots. 

Dubs have had same players together for longer, and running the system for half a season longer. "
"263","Warriors","Regardless of the outcome it would be fun to watch if you're a neutral fan. Even if one of the teams sweep, I don't see those games being blowouts. The smooth shooting and handles of Curry and Irving (if healthy?) mixed with the excitement Lebron gives and the tenacity and workmanship guys like Draymond Green and Tristan Thompson give would make for a fun time. Also, two Aussies will be playing again."
"264","Warriors","I think the Cavs are being overestimated.  They've been playing well, but they've been feasting on totally subpar Eastern Conference teams."
"265","Warriors","At least the guy took it like a man and didn't delete it. "
"266","Warriors","If you're looking at Iggy it's questionable to pick him but not Barnes. "
"267","Warriors","easier said then done when the shot goes up with 19 seconds left on the shot clock"
"268","Warriors","LOL.  Please come back to reality.  You have a SJW political AG who has ties to the defense charging police officers with murder because they didn't put on a seatbelt on a thug who was resisting arrest/ran.  

Can't wait to see the riots after the officers are acquitted because the AG is incompetent.

Guess what the officers in this case won't be found guilty of any crime because they didn't break any law.

Get back to me when it isn't some thug breaking the law and ending up injured."
"269","Warriors","Where's the 60 footer?"
"270","Warriors","You're right! My mistake. "
"271","Warriors","Is he better than Gasol, Boogie, or maybe even DJ? No. Is he better than Andre Drummond? Seriously?"
"272","Warriors","You're retarded and I'm done responding to you "
"273","Warriors","I think he was definitely elite last year. He put up 24/8.5 on 61% true shooting. That's an MVP season with more wins (which can be said of a lot of seasons to be fair)."
"274","Warriors","Before he was hurt he was the most harmful player you could have on your team. The man was throwing up sooooo many shots but only shot like 35%"
"275","Warriors","He is absolutely guarding 1s and 2s on switches very often."
"276","Warriors","I think in our system, he is a max player.  I think some other teams might be foolish to give him the max.  "
"277","Warriors","I'm pretty sure he was thinking I'm not going to give Houston fans a good show so I'll just give them a lazy dunk "
"278","Warriors","He'll have a ""max"" for a year, then the cap will skyrocket and his deal will seem like a bargain.  If Lacob is really willing to pay the luxury tax to keep this team together like he said he would be, then its a no question, give this dude the max!"
"279","Warriors","The Spurs have a far better system than the Knicks (if they even have anything that would resemble the charred remains of a dumpster fire that was fueled by a ""system""). Kawhi is a monster, yes. But if I was to grab a player right now and build a team that had to win tomorrow I would pick Melo."
"280","Warriors","Who?  Whos Kobe?  Lol :("
"281","Warriors","Idk why you're being downvoted. I would at least have Chandler as #9 or 10"
"282","Warriors","Let them walk off.  NBA playing 'thought police' in an effort to extort an NBA franchise out of an owner is pathetic regardless of your opinions on his positions which in reality weren't racist at all.

Might have been a bit bigoted but certainly not racist."
"283","Warriors","You mean wasn't built on tanking?  We kinda tanked to get barnes but as far as I know, that's about it?  "
"284","Warriors","&gt; Either I'm not getting the rest of the stories where police officers who killed non threatening or even totally innocent people get convicted or something is very rotten over there in the US.

You are not getting the entire story."
"285","Warriors","&gt; I thought there should be MUCH more media pressure for this.


Why?  There is no story.  NBA player at the scene of a fight/stabbing resists arrest while intoxicated and ends up with a broken ankle. "
"286","Warriors","I love me some Andrew Bogut and Ricky Rubio makes me question my sexual identity."
"287","Warriors","Westbrook?"
"288","Warriors","Shocked to see Dray in here! He's a bulldog on the court but you can tell in his interviews that he's educated and level-headed"
"289","Warriors","There was one play where Nick Johnson was playing very physical defense with steph and lead him right into a josh smith hard screen/borderline foul, and then after that everyone just walked away from steph and left him open for a 3.

How do you spend so much effort roughing up a player only to just completely forget about him the next second? "
"290","Warriors","What do you mean by this?  Is his accomplishment not too impressive to you because he only did it in 13 games? "
"291","Warriors","Ah, I gotcha. "
"292","Warriors","&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if they don't get convicted

Exactly, so you agree that they broke no law and are not guilty of a crime.  Thank you."
"293","Warriors","Well there's plenty of darkskinned players who lack defensive talent (dion waiters with his short arms, boris diaw being kinda chubby), but more often than not good defensive comes from length. Most people who originated from African descent tend to have longer wingspans than their heights,  at least in the nba. People who originate from west Europe tend to jave similar wingspans to their heights. White players with outstretched arms seem to mostly come from eastern Europe (jonas valenciusoshakha, alex len, andrew bogut, but there are some black players who have short arms too (think glen davis). Some of the most athletic white dudes can never become great defenders from their lack of length (cody zeller and the plumlee brothers), so it comes down to that. "
"294","Warriors","Still just one game. Memphis looks like they had our number and then they magically didn't."
"295","Warriors","No thanks.  I wouldn't even trade Iggy for Kobe straight up.  "
"296","Warriors","""MJ is hated in Salt Lake, Seattle, New York and Cleveland because of his triumphs.""


I don't think that's true. "
"297","Warriors","And the proposed trade is hypothetically aweful.  Hypothetically suck it.  "
"298","Warriors","Trade Steph, Curry, Dray and Barnes! We should have tanked when we had the chance. Let's start rebuilding people!!!"
"299","Warriors","If he wins a championship I could see the hate. "
"300","Warriors","also different. that's when the ballhandler's defender shifts his position to block the screen. there's youtube videos on that too"
"301","Warriors","I started to notice that too. Especially at Oracle, it's a great way to get the crowd going. "
"302","Warriors","in transition basketball the #1 priority is always the paint. yes steph is an amazing shooter but anyone in the nba is basically automatic from point blank. try to run steph off the three point line in a transition situation he'll hit a cutting hb, dray, iggy etc for a flush at the basket. there is a reason the warriors play at the pace they do, it frees up their shooters. youll see what im talking about next round "
"303","Warriors","It's a joke"
"304","Warriors","Don't trade your pick. "
"305","Warriors","He's not really been lowkey lol.  "
"306","Warriors","*implying anyone could break his leg*"
"307","Warriors","Sounds like his performance last night"
"308","Warriors","My bad, I was thinking all playoffs.  
Still, I don't see what is wrong with examining his averages in the three games of the series.  It's ridiculous no matter how big the sample size is.  Your post would make more sense if the title was something like ""Currys career averages in the WCF are ____ ""  because it would be worth noting that he's only played 3 WCF games ever.  But its obvious we are only examining the three games so sample size doesn't really matter.   Mentioning sample size is only relevant when the sample size is not clear and the stats could be misleading.  These are not, those are Currys INSANE averages from 3 games.  "
"309","Warriors","Never said he wasn't,  but he never had the ideal tools"
"310","Warriors","Of course. That's not the kind of player he is. This isn't fucking 1990, though, so your offense shouldn't just be to put the ball in your highest-paid player's hands and have him ISO."
"311","Warriors","[Good.](https://i.imgflip.com/g13fl.gif)"
"312","Warriors","Data Request for ESPN- break that down further into number of threes made w/ percentages: off the dribble and spot up. "
"313","Warriors","If you made this, you are a genius."
"314","Warriors","Oh so Zach Lowe doesn't watch tape? According to him Curry had been a very good defender and Westbrook has been a liability this season. Sounds like you're not watching the games, and are just assuming the more athletic guy is a better defender."
"315","Warriors","Weird for Warriors fans, to be honest. We've never been good enough to hate on until this year and it's all happening so fast. I wish this season would last forever."
"316","Warriors","Nope. "
"317","Warriors","Screencapped"
"318","Warriors","I just had this conversation last night with a friend who is a fan of another team. I tried to explain to him that it still feels like a dream. "
"319","Warriors","I need to remember this. "
"320","Warriors","it would be interesting to see them break that down further into number of threes made w/ percentages: off the dribble and spot up."
"321","Warriors","LOL"
"322","Warriors","I think in this scenario, the Sixers would still take the best asset regardless of position, which would be the smart move. You don't pass on Tim Duncan because David Robinson is your center. You don't pass on MJ because Clyde Drexler is your guard, and you don't draft Darko Milicic because Tayshaun Prince is your small forward. Always, always, take the best player.

That being said, it'd also be kind of hilarious."
"323","Warriors","And it would be the same pattern
1st round: swept the Pelicans
2nd round: beat the Grizzlies in 6
WCF: potential sweep against the Rockets"
"324","Warriors","People don't want to give him props. "
"325","Warriors","Lakers"
"326","Warriors","Summoning /u/Rabsho"
"327","Warriors","The Knicks are so fucked. "
"328","Warriors","Gtfoh, I've been a fan since the days of Reggie Williams, Tolliver, Azubuike, etc..."
"329","Warriors","Problem is our offense is predicated towards movement. If anyone was selfish we wouldn't be able to score. we have no more than 2 or 3 players who can score in isolation"
"330","Warriors","Hahaha sorry I'm an idiot.  I just realized /s means sarcasm.  "
"331","Warriors","sous chef harden. he was runner up for mvp after all"
"332","Warriors","Bucks with Jabari"
"333","Warriors","People have said this all season when our fans point out that he guards 1-5 and it's just false. He truly does guard point guards and centers and does it well. That's not an exaggeration. We're not trying to argue he could bang down low with a guy like Gasol/Boogie for 40 minutes but he can do it in small doses and be effective. "
"334","Warriors","I honestly can't say I ever see Harden winning a championship either. Hard to describe but it's kinda like would you ever imagine AI winning an NBA championship and the answer is gonna be no. Both of them are bonafide ABSOLUTE STUDS but idk I just don't see it happening."
"335","Warriors","there's no black and white. Every game is different,  every game had context. We didn't match the cavs intensity. LeBron fucking james decided he wanted to win that game, and he did. Every game is different game. We fouled them 500 times that game, and our defensive was lackadaisical. We won't be able to win with how we played that game, so we won't. People forget that every game is different. Even without ky and kevin love the cavs are a very good team. Our offense has improved so much these past couple of games, and we saw that we don't even need to hit shots as long as we play D, pass, and take care of the ball. Don't bring up regular season matchups when they don't really matter."
"336","Warriors","win mvp"
"337","Warriors","Bucks, twolves, lakers, magic. Shout out to Charlotte too."
"338","Warriors","""Kind of tanked"""
"339","Warriors","Why do people come up with this shitty metric of needing to have the ability to lead a sub par team for a player to be truly great? Every great championship team and their star player has been surrounded by other studs. Jordan had plenty. James had plenty. If you would take 6 guys over Curry, you're either really ignorant or lying to yourself. "
"340","Warriors","I feel like it's 1st for everyone, so they can take whoever they want?"
"341","Warriors","I mean, we do Penetrate often and kick out to swing. so phil isn't completely wrong."
"342","Warriors","Let's send it over to the Subway Fresh Take Hotline "
"343","Warriors","That's what cops do, they purposefully force resistance. Watch the video Thabo wasn't resisting at all, the cops had a hard time 'getting him where they wanted him' because they were purposefully rocking his body back and fourth."
"344","Warriors","IT WAS AN ASSIST. "
"345","Warriors","It's not cheering. Who's going to cheer for the other guy down 2 in the WCF"
"346","Warriors","I'm still proud that we were able to take 2 from the spurs,  while almost winning game 1. Looking back, we ran some really funky offensive 'sets' that postseason. "
"347","Warriors","Well, how long has it been since he's played at DPOY-level?  "
"348","Warriors","i completely agree by official terms that was a foul. that being said one of the biggest big men in the league lets a guy that is a normal sized human being hold him off? if he put alittle heart into that play and didnt play like a cream puff that rebound is his "
"349","Warriors","How you gonna leave out Mike Montgomery like that? "
"350","Warriors","That would be a sign of weakness.

""6 letter Bitch"" is on his tombstone. "
"351","Warriors","Well, what's your take on Dwight's mental game;  How would you describe his BBIQ and/or his heart?
"
"352","Warriors","This is also a fair take on it."
"353","Warriors","Not saying you're wrong but people also said the same thing about those who predicted a sweep over the Rockets. While this hasn't happened yet obviously, a lot of people were saying it would be ridiculous that the Dubs would control that series but here we are."
"354","Warriors","With that bench?"
"355","Warriors","That's amazing. Sure the defense against it may not be the best, but you gotta be impressed by how Kerr runs the team to make efficient use of their weapons. Also, to be fair to Houston, it's hard to keep Curry in check when you also need to watch for Thompson shooting from anywhere, Barnes shooting from the corner, and Dray pulling up from the top of the key."
"356","Warriors","TIL uncontested is six feet. I couldn't make a 3 pointer with double that space!"
"357","Warriors","omg seriously the image he got fired for is used everywhere now"
"358","Warriors","I think Kerr would be the first person to tell you that too. "
"359","Warriors","I guess we didn't tank the whole year, we started tanking near the end of the season right?  We were kinda just bad, but not really 7th worst bad.  "
"360","Warriors","I don't watch the comments on his plays, but he's absolutely an above average player right now even if people pretend he isn't because he's not playing like his former MVP self. "
"361","Warriors","Draymond has freaking killed it in the playoffs"
"362","Warriors","Man"
"363","Warriors","Why is it so ridiculous to say a 67 win team with an all time high point differential and tops in many offensive and defensive categories is a tough matchup for anyone? The hate has become so insane that anytime a Warriors fan points out how great this team has played all year is ""too cocky"" and ""insufferable"". I'm sorry that we think our team is the best and we believe we're going to win it all."
"364","Warriors","Lebron James. "
"365","Warriors","We only tanked to get Barnes, every other year before we legitimately sucked."
"366","Warriors","A role player is quite simply a player who fills a specific role. Danny Green is a great example. Plays great wing defense and shoots 3. That's his role on the team. The difference between him and say Klay Thompson, a 2015 all star, is actually quite a bit. First of all Klay can score in isolation and he can do it from anywhere on the floor. At the rim, mid range, and from 3. He can also defend very very well. So while Danny Green fills one specific role Klay fulfills that same role in many different ways and he's better at it. "
"367","Warriors","Mo and steph will run pick and pops, but steph will be the pop man and mo will be the primary ball handler. Klay thompson will hit more 3s than steph,  andre iguodala will hit more 3s than miss them, harrison barnes will outrebound lebron on a Percentage standpoint. leandro Barbosa will hit a midrange J, shaun livingston will not attempt a single turnaround, bogues scores at least 10 points per game, draymond will lead the series in assists and defensive rebounds, festus ezeli doesn't miss a single hook shot, david lee scores more than 6 points a single game, brandon rush boasts a positive +/-"
"368","Warriors","Lmao this is great. While we're at it, Harrison Barnes is almost certainly a japanese basketball robot. He plays like a robot, talks like a robot, and I'm pretty sure I've caught him on the bench a few times in standby mode."
"369","Warriors","Maybe with the luck we've had."
"370","Warriors","anyone who ""just for some reason can't stand steph curry"" is secretly insecure about their manhood"
"371","Warriors","That's true, but isn't that also penetration? if we didn't have players who could score inside, that spacing would be obsolete. "
"372","Warriors","Porpoise*"
"373","Warriors","&gt;When Curry has a bad shooting night people say ""he missed shots he usually makes"" but if Russ does it he's viewed as a chucker. 

Maybe because there is an element of truth to those statements. Curry's career average true shooting is 60.2%, Westbrook's is 52.5%. Curry is far and away the more efficient scorer so he gets the benefit of the doubt when he has a bad shooting night."
"374","Warriors","David is almost the same david he always has been. Can't switch him, can't spread the floor, etc. He just didn't fit our system,  but has still done what he's always done. "
"375","Warriors","Ahhhh I see. Sorry, I misunderstood.

Assuming the first 5 are:

1) Lebron
2) KD
3) AD
4) Harden
5) Curry

I'd probably want pick in the 3-10 range then. A young superstar is so important and there are several of those in the NBA now. Even if I could get a guy like Paul George, you can get some great picks in the 50's with potential. Like maybe Whiteside or some other younger dudes."
"376","Warriors","Tristan Thompson has had a great postseason especially on the offensive glass. Of course Draymond Green too. Also Schroeder may have had a tough series so far but I've loved what I've seen from him in the playoffs as a whole"
"377","Warriors","That's pretty tasteless."
"378","Warriors","His midrange shot was one of the main weapons in his arsenal. he was pretty good too, ~40-45%. He could both pop and roll on pick sets with good results. Last season though,  he just stopped shooting much. According to him,  there were so many outside shots that he just thought it best to go inside more than join the rest of the crew bombing away. But I guess rythym is important when it comes to jump shots,  because I've witnessed nothing but bricks from his jump shots thus far. "
"379","Warriors","Thank you. I didn't know that"
"380","Warriors","If Curry can shoot over Dwight, he can certainly shoot over Shumps flattop. "
"381","Warriors","I really wanna just make a thread titled ""Curry?"" and just write ""thoughts?"". I won't though. "
"382","Warriors","Hell fucking no. THAT'S how I know Kerr is underrated. "
"383","Warriors","He's like 185"
"384","Warriors","Curry absolutely was a better defender as of this season. Zach Lowe, for one mentioned Curry as an honorable mention to his all-defensive teams and has called Westbrook a detriment on defense this season. Unlike 99% of this sub, Lowe knows what he's talking about and doesn't just assume the more atheletic player is the better defender. I'd also argue Curry is the better passer/playmaker, but I admit that's debatable. So let's turn it around- what is Westbrook clearly better at than Curry besides rebounding?"
"385","Warriors","I mean we tanked about as blatantly and shamelessly as anyone has, save for the 76ers these last few seasons. I don't mind, we had no reason to try and be competitive and we got a blue chip prospect out of it.

Although it does illustrate how much of a gamble tanking is. The real game changing picks we've made were Curry and Green, both guys we didn't tank to get. If we had been counting on Barnes to be a all-star, it would have been rough."
"386","Warriors","I like it :)"
"387","Warriors","Mavs and Portland fall out of the top 8 while Thunder and ? move in. I don't think that ? is the Kings though. The Suns are going to want to make some moves too. Utah will probably be better than both of them. "
"388","Warriors","They would have lost to Memphis.  Iso ball would have killed them during that series and I don't know if Jackson would've figured out the move of putting Bogut on Allen."
"389","Warriors","Much more likely they sign LMA and are top tier again. "
"390","Warriors","That was the problem. We were never bad enough to pick in the top 3 but we were never good enough to make the playoffs. Our draft picks never panned out for us until we drafted Curry. Just to give you a small sample size, here are our previous draft picks before we landed Curry. Dunleavy, pietrus, Anthony Randolph, Brandan wright, belineli, Patrick O Bryant, Ike Diogu. All of these players were first round picks and more than half of them are already out of the league. The rest are role players in other teams."
"391","Warriors","He wouldn't have, though. That was one of the things he feuded with management about. "
"392","Warriors","I would assume that might also be because CP3 was injured. "
"393","Warriors","I'm thinking that some refs would call the foul on Dwight for putting his right arm under Steph's right arm (which is extended horizontally in a natural-looking way while Steph gathers to jump) from the back and bringing his arm up quickly which causes their arms to hook and since Dwight's so much stronger, it causes Curry's arm to be yanked around before he can pull it free.  That could be considered a foul.
Personally, I think it's a good no-call on the rebound since the contact could be considered incidental given that their arms did not remain locked up.  (In fact, it's with the right arm that Steph makes his putback shot attempt.)"
"394","Warriors","He is a big reason, yes."
"395","Warriors","You're a hipster =/"
"396","Warriors","We're not a 60 win team and who knows what happens during the year? Harrison Barnes wouldn't start and David Lee would either be starting or getting way more playing time. Mo Speights would barely be used. Who knows what type of offense he'd try making Livingston fit into? 

We'd be worse off, that's for sure."
"397","Warriors","I'm pretty sure Steve Nash wasn't that light. "
"398","Warriors","We wouldn't have Draymond playing the PF under Jackson, he never tried the Warriors starting line-up this year for one minute last year."
"399","Warriors","Where do you see them joining?"
"400","Warriors","Under Jackson, Draymond never played as a PF."
"401","Warriors","he's just cold right now, one of the reasons why I think that he didn't deserve and all-nba team spot. I love the guy to death but he's way too inconsistent."
"402","Warriors","Draymond never played PF under Mark Jackson, hell the Warriors starting line-up this year never played a minute together under Jackson."
"403","Warriors","Free throw shooting, turnovers, three point shooting.

We're splitting hairs though, because they are only weaknesses relative to the rest of his game"
"404","Warriors","Gasol and Z-Bo vs Lee and Bogut? They'd be scoring at will against Lee. Draymond would have been a SF under Jackson."
"405","Warriors","looks like the SF skyline"
"406","Warriors","The runner-up DPOY was a SF under Mark Jackson, Kerr was willing to try him at PF after Lee got injured and it worked out. The Warriors starting line-up this year didn't play a single minute under Jackson. 

Kerr uses his assistants very well and Kerr definitely gets too much credit, but everyone acknowledges how good Adams and Gentry are."
"407","Warriors","They would have been good, but not nearly this good. I think they would have been a ~55 win team in the regular season, compared to the 67 that they got under Kerr. "
"408","Warriors","since 80% of the posts in thread are saying the very same thing, I guess  you are not the only one. 

Looks to me like less contact than almost every battle under the hoop though, but oh well. 
"
"409","Warriors","In my dream I'm Alton Lister getting dunked on by Shawn Kemp."
"410","Warriors","He should play over seas. His brand is huge and competition is weaker. He could play five more years for one of those clubs. And he can speak Italian to the media."
"411","Warriors","Yea I don't really buy this as a reason they're this far. Take LBJ off the team and you still think they get this far because of ""Finals experience"" and ""leadership""? Cmon man LBJ is the reason they're this far and if you think otherwise you're kidding yourself."

"415","Warriors","Turnovers, playing consistent defense, and his jumpshot."
"416","Warriors","Its like you have no idea how this shit works.  Six cops did not fuck him up. Six cops restrained him after he was resisting. Why six? Because six were available, they didn't know what state of mind he was in and drug/drunk strong people are tough to deal with without excessive use of force. If you are so concerned about the treatment of poor thabo then you should pay more attention to the beginning of this video where he resists detainment."

"421","Warriors","Setting screens isn't penetration. The Warriors offense is not particularly dependent on dudes attacking the rim. They get their points by getting their shooter space in other ways. "
"422","Warriors","Wait, so they didn't tank that one season because they had a #1 pick that would go to another team (Utah, I think) if they finished better than 7th worst?  And didn't that pick turn into Harrison Barnes?
"
"423","Warriors","dray is a triple double waiting to happen"
"424","Warriors","Kerr retooled the entire offensive system. They went from the bottom in the league in PPP to first by quite a bit. And even if you credit Gentry Kerr went out and got him and Adams. "
"425","Warriors","As is tradition"
"426","Warriors","*could* + *might*"
"427","Warriors","Speights or Festus would probably play when Lee went down, Jackson never tried Draymond at the 4 once last year."
"428","Warriors","Not when down huge in a playoff game at home.  That just screams ""IDGAF""."
"429","Warriors","Smart move."
"430","Warriors","I don't think any coach with disagree.  But, penetration leads to open threes which I'd take over a contested 2."
"431","Warriors","Why would having a coach that caters to his best players strengths take away from the player at all? Do you see what Steph does and the shots he makes? Kerr is  a big reason Steph was able to fully showcase his abilities and leadership, but Steph is the one doing these things. No one else, but Steph can do what he does. Period."
"432","Warriors","Steph still would have been right there in the MVP discussion if the Warriors were in the vicinity of 55-60 wins. Also he would be relied on way more heavily on offense if Mark Jackson were still coach, so his counting stats would have been up. He would probably have averaged something like 26/9 in the regular season "
"433","Warriors","You dont understand, at this point, in the video, law enforcement has determined that thabo needs detainment. For what reason does not matter within the scope of the video. Thabo decides to resist. Those two facts lead to escalation. Once its time cuffs, they arent concerned with context they are concerned with control."
"434","Warriors","I watched again closely, and while sober, and after catching the ball, Curry [clearly has a grip on Dwight's bicep](http://i.imgur.com/vDbOUsR.png) in this frame, holding Dwight away from the ball.

But I also think you're right that Dwight could have just dropped his right arm and reached over Steph, tipping the ball to Harden standing nearby.

So I agree it's a good no-call. Gotta just play on sometimes, especially in the playoffs."

"439","Warriors","We may not win either game one or two against Houston without Shaun Livingston."
"440","Warriors","I can see why people hate Green or Bogut...but Steph is a saint compared to those two.  He may get emotional on the court but he's humble and doesn't disrespect the other team.  I can't think of one NBA player who has said they dislike Steph."
"441","Warriors","Draymond and Bogut are a gift after decades of Gatling, Fortson, Foyle, Dampier, Troy Murphy, Biedrens, and Owens. "
"442","Warriors","The 2015 NBA champions."
"443","Warriors","It took Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli and Jermaine O'Neal all being injured for it to come to that."
"444","Warriors","One tank pick that ended up being a solid rotation piece isn't ""built on tanking"".

If anything, our team was built on ""legitimately playing awful defensive lineups and injury woes"" between 08-12."
"445","Warriors","So, since no one in the US is paying attention to hockey, the combination of no sports news and good weather has apparently turned everyone into a fucking retard. I really hope they move up the Finals because I don't feel like listening to two full weeks of this shit."

"447","Warriors","It's actually pretty cool that Phil Jackson is giving his real opinions on Twitter."

"449","Warriors","He never played Draymond at the 4 until the playoffs when all 3 of our centers got injured and David Lee had to play center against DeAndre Jordan."
"450","Warriors","The reffing in particular."
"451","Warriors","Rabsho hates Barnes to a hilarious degree."

"456","Warriors","Glen Davis"
"457","Warriors","The Warriors aren't that team you're right, they're better in fact. 67-15 in the regular season and about to sweep the best the Western Conference can offer. "
"458","Warriors","Didn't we also tank so as to not lose the draft pick? It wasn't just about getting better position because we owed the pick to somebody else under protection."
"459","Warriors","I think the Warriors having a better defense than anything the Cavs had played thus far in the Playoffs helps too. "
"460","Warriors","Would be quite a show, but I dunno. Depends on Ky I guess. If he doesn't play completely or is &gt; 50% I could see it. If he's 75%+ (what he probably will be) I could see dubs In 5."
"461","Warriors","His season basically did. "
"462","Warriors","Darko did too."
"463","Warriors","How soon we forget the great Patrick O'Bryant"
"464","Warriors","Honestly, if they take the title this year with the way he's playing he'd have a chance for top All Star votes, regular season MVP, playoff MVP, finals MVP, and all 3 point records just this season. That almost makes him a lock, whatever happens after. "
"465","Warriors","You know nothing about how his fibula broke other than it happened that night and police were very likely to certainly involved. Your scope of fucked up is your own opinion.

And no you dont know how this shit works. He failed to comply with a verbal order to get down, he resists physical detainment. He is the cause of his own escalation. Once its decided to put the cuffs on its no longer about right wrong or how oppressed you are, its about controlling the situation.

No i dont give a fuck about your situation because there are so many good and bad cops out there. Who knows which one you got. I have no TMZ video of your oppression and I'm not even sure you're not full of shit."
"466","Warriors","I was just wondering if anyone has worn the Ocho since he cut the fro."
"467","Warriors","Players still play even if they don't look injured though especially during playoffs. Aside from the face, Conley seemed alright too but after he was asked he said his everything was hurting. Tony Allen injured his hamstring too, but no one really knew until someone reported it. "
"468","Warriors","In one word....WET"
"469","Warriors","Yes he did...he played him as center too in the Clippers series last year..."
"470","Warriors","God I hated/loved Reke so much that year.  Wish 2015 Boogie got to play with him."
"471","Warriors","We never went cold. We just played poorly cause Memphis played D and we were still immature. It took us those 2 games to grow and trust our team. We could've been considered 'cold' as a team standpoint, but we didn't deviate from what allowed us to win games and thus we won the game. "
"472","Warriors","I would say a few of us did. And I'll say this now. He's getting better. Not leap and bounds better. But expect him to keep beating his own records for each of the next three years. "
"473","Warriors","IMO Davis &gt; Westbrook"
"474","Warriors","Eh we were the first-ranked defense in the regular season. Also I'd have to argue Memphis is a much better defensive team than the Cavs. "
"475","Warriors","I have trouble believing that,  but I guess it's easier remembering missed shots than made shots. Than and his form makes it easy to speculation that he's a poor shooter. This is an important weapon in his arsenal. Maybe the last thing he needs."
"476","Warriors","I think it has to do with being a winner. Kobe does the same thing. He has backed his arrogance up with an all time great career. Yeah Curry and Blake are not on that level but when you look around the league you can see that they are two of the guys that have a chance to get to that level. "
"477","Warriors","Yeah but the article talks about that. It seems it was a premeditated move by him."
"478","Warriors","Yeah. Why would it not? Isnt that obvious?"
"479","Warriors","If u check out his post allstar break numbers you could see he was going to be elite. I think he averaged like 22/5/7 on elite ts "
"480","Warriors","Has to be Pekovic. Guy could probably wrestle a grizzly bear and Zangief at the same time. "
"481","Warriors","Yea he definitely has the undeniable ability to lead his teams to the second round"
"482","Warriors","In all seriousness being the son of an NBA player helps. He's been around this environment as a kid. The ""big moment"" does not faze him.

He may not have hit the genetic lottery but he definitely benefits from his upbringing and pedigree."
"483","Warriors","first it was ""howard isn't healthy"" in game 1, then it was the ""refs"" in games 2 and 3, not its beverly"
"484","Warriors","It took Andrew Bogut, Festus Ezeli and Jermaine O'Neal all being injured for Dray to play PF.
"
"485","Warriors","As much as I want to see curry against lebron against green blah blah, I want to see JR Smith against Thompson.

I don't know why, just having a crazy feeling that the both of them would catch fire in the same game."
"486","Warriors","JW, but what is stopping steph from being the 2nd best player in the league now? "
"487","Warriors","""he pushed off""

I'm not trying to give Jazz fans a hard time. He did indeed push off Byron Russell.

This is exactly the type of thing the article is talking about though. You have to respect MJ as goat but some fans of other teams will have a little lingering resentment because of the things he has done to ""their guys."""
"488","Warriors","How did this happen? How did he go so low? I mean that kind of talent doesn't come out of nowhere right?"
"489","Warriors","You're not wrong. That rebound was a statement in this series. "
"490","Warriors","Obviously winning two finals is great regardless of how many attempts it takes. But in GOAT discussions, rings matter. 6-0 by Jordan would be better than a potential 5-3 by Lebron. Lebron would have to get to 6 rings to get for his finals losses to not count against him in GOAT discussions."
"491","Warriors","Fully agree with your first sentence.
"
"492","Warriors","dominate censorship"
"493","Warriors","Harrison Barnes is pretty strong muscle-wise. He's a little lean, but the dude is a rock. It's why we have him playing the 4. He's pretty good at guarding the post against natural 4s and 5s"
"494","Warriors","Sometimes it does I'm sure like when you don't know how to invest it or you have a bunch of people you care about keep asking you for loans, etc.  It sucks when all you want is simplicity.  It definitely has it's perks but it will make certain people become haters towards you which means you just experience that hostility no matter what you do."
"495","Warriors","You guys are notso Smart."
"496","Warriors","Well both the east and west have great teams, and beating the best team in the east or west is hard to do. Sometimes the conference disparity may lead to one conference having 2 or more teams better than the best team of the other conference, but the cavs, minus kyrie and kevin love are still pretty good."
"497","Warriors","Larry Riley was the one who drafted Curry. "
"498","Warriors","I was sceptical of maxing him 2-3 months ago but now I think he's earned it."
"499","Warriors","You are right.  This should really only matter to the Utah Jazz."
"500","Warriors","Use streamable.com"
"501","Warriors","Carmello Anthony. He's supposed to be an MVP caliber player, and yet I feel he's one of the reasons the Knicks have been run into the ground."
"502","Warriors","To be honest, I think success does breed hate - I've seen a lot more comments on /r/nba this year than ever before about how ""smug"" or ""punchable"" Steph's face is. 

You mention Tim Duncan and Dirk, who are loved by many NBA fans but they also do have plenty of haters (mostly uneducated people who don't know much about basketball and call them soft, but nonetheless they wouldn't be getting hate without the success)

If Steph keeps balling at this level for an extended amount of time, the amount of haters he has will grow. The fun part will be seeing what sorts of reasons people invent to hate on him."

"512","Warriors","Some people here already claim he is the GOAT, so yeah in that context he is overrated."
"513","Warriors","Along with what other people said, the normal break for football is already one week, so a 2 week break is only double the normal break time, along the lines of three days off for basketball."
"514","Warriors","Patch 21.0 Steph has been removed from the game. The results of the last patch had no effect he still made too many threes. So in all fairness he has been removed. We hope this helps"
"515","Warriors","Context is key, offenses in the West are so much better bar Atlanta and Cavs. "
"516","Warriors","LeBron is better, no doubt.  There's no reason to expect Durant to be any worse after recovering fully from his foot, and if he does fully recover, he remains all-world.  Curry is also currently all-world, but Durant has been there for a few years now, and has proven that it's his consistent playing level.  Curry's only had the one truly great year.  Remember, Kevin Durant is younger than Steph."
"517","Warriors","Ungodly.  Duncan's been around for so long, we've forgotten how dominant he was in his prime.  "
"518","Warriors","But he did play him at PF/Center.  "

"531","Warriors","In the beginning of the season I wanted to say Kawhi, but I'm a believer now. I'll say Kyrie Irving, he was the best player on the team before LeBron came back, Kyrie could never push the cavs to even getting close to the playoffs and now LeBron makes everyone on the team look better including him. He's good but not as good as people make him out to be. "

"544","Warriors","Who were you most excited about that turned out to suck?  I remember furiously googling Ekpe Udoh and getting somewhat excited.  Also Anthony Randolph was a yearly potential tease.  "
"545","Warriors","He's already top 3...and it's pointless to argue who's the best of those three (Paul, Westbrook, Curry) because it mostly comes down to individual opinion.  Paul is a more traditional PG and the least risky pick.  Westbrook can put up the most monster numbers of the 3 but he's also the least efficient and least consistent of the 3.  Curry is the best offensively but the worst defensively of the 3."
"546","Warriors","That sorta proves his point, doesn't it? Curry literally out muscled Dwight."
"547","Warriors","Lebron will go down as one of the 5 greatest players ever to play basketball, if not *the* best player of all time. That said, 2015 Lebron isn't the same transcendent, best-player-in-basketball Lebron he was in years past. I really think he's merely ""very, very good"" now, and there are 3 or 4 players I'd rather have on my team -- Curry, Harden, and AD for sure."

"555","Warriors","Criminals generally being injured as a result of their decision to break laws and subsequently not follow lawful police orders.

Exactly like this case.  Had he not decided to resist arrest, the police wouldn't have had to use force to control his person which is what lead to the broken leg.  He made a conscious decision to refuse to obey a lawful police order and then resist arrest."
"556","Warriors","That honestly is never going to happen. If he kept his scoring up and had 10 assists per game he would be absolutely dominating the ball in a system designed around moving it around to everyone. Everyones supposed to get a touch."

But if you talk to educated people, people willing to think things through for themselves, you find things aren't so black and white.

It's also human nature, though, to look on things with envy and enjoy their failures.  Maybe a shitty part of human nature, but it's there."
"561","Warriors","that's great, have one more upvote

have you been on /r/nba since 2009? what was it like back then?"
"562","Warriors","&gt;  Paul is a more traditional PG and the least risky pick. Westbrook can put up the most monster numbers of the 3 but he's also the least efficient and least consistent of the 3. Curry is the best offensively but the worst defensively of the 3.

No he definitely isn't the worst defensively."

They've been able to win three in a row using grit to overcome adversity, and at the same time have demonstrated their ability to soar past a solid Rockets team who have themselves shown their ability to fight through adversity this year. 

Point is, Dubs have gotten it done in a complete manner in this series and that's why they are up 3 - 0. 

You know the drill, hand down, man down. "

"569","Warriors","Warriors in 6."
"570","Warriors","We're up 3-0. We played horrifically in terms of unforced careless turnovers and still won both games despite Harden going off. And now we just beat them in historic fashion in their own house with our 6'2 180lb PG out muscling a 6'11 295lb monster. How is that not a statement? We turned the ball over once in the first half and that's why we were leading by 25. Series is over. "

"584","Warriors","I know a team has never come back from being down 3-0...but it's kinda disrespectful to proclaim the Rockets losers when the Warriors still need to win a game."
"585","Warriors","I feel like it is better to judge players in tiers.  Tier 1 I would say this year is James, Paul, Harden, and Curry.  Tier 2 is Durant(only because I want to see how he responds to his injury, would easily be the second best player again if he comes back playing the same), Westbrook, AD, Griffin, Gasol. "
"586","Warriors","I think Phil Jackson is getting too easily dismissed for this opinion (which is an accurate one) because of his implication that 3-point shooting teams won't be successful in the playoffs.  If you watch last night's highlights, at least 1/3 of the Warriors' shots from beyond the arc started with a player getting into the paint and then passing to the 3-point shooter.

He was wrong with the whole ""how's it goink"" tweet, but Phil Jackson is still one of the greatest basketball minds who has ever lived.  I sincerely doubt that the game has changed so much since 2011 that he has absolutely no idea what he's talking about now.  Dude's still a bball genius."

"593","Warriors","Well, you could argue that it was a statement in the sense that the Warriors had just barely won their two home games and wanted to make it known that that could take care of business on the road. I agree with you though, I think that one incident was just that: an incident."

All Karl Malone wants to do in life is hunt, fish, and play basketball.

"628","Warriors","The *pace and space* of Kerr's offense ensures Curry gets a lot more quality shots than last year.  Draymond and Klay are young and you expect them to improve especially when Curry's spacing the floor well past the 3 point line."

"653","Warriors","Eh, he's a bit above average. The stats are hard to parse out because he's always been on excellent defensive teams overall, but what he lacks in physical tools he makes up for with excellent positioning and potentially the best hands in the game. If you consider rebounding part of defense, he's a top-5 rebounder among short guys. 

There are obviously better defenders at his position, but the Warriors don't have to hide him anymore. "
"654","Warriors","We do I completely agree but in my opinion iggy can guard anyone klay can. Maybe not quite as well but it isn't a huge downgrade. However if we get Kevin Love, you gotta wonder how Draymond would have developed..."

"663","Warriors","If you're going on a single game, then you can just as well say that the dubs defense was languid and unfocused, and fouled unnecessarily. I'm not saying that lebron isn't going to score, but going off a single regular season game doesn't indicate anything"

"673","Warriors","It looks like you're new to Reddit.  And based on your question, you probably haven't lurked a lot in /r/nba.  So rather than implying that you're stupid, I would suggest that you try to do the following:

* Lurk more
* Google your question before asking about it
* Learn more about basketball
* Use the Reddit search engine (your question has been asked before... and downvoted before because, the way it's worded, people think the OP is implying that LeBron and Curry/Harden/Durant/Blake or whoever are equal.... they're not.  LeBron is the best player in the world).

Anyway, good luck on future posts."
"674","Warriors","Is it really ""illegal"" if both player and team agreed to it? What makes it illegal?

EDIT: Just in case people don't understand I do agree with the punishment it makes clear sense so teams can't do that to the players they want to keep but I am just curious as to what makes this any different then say Dirk signing for less besides Smith signing for REALLLY less."

"680","Warriors","Tony Parker. 

IMO, he was never the best/most important player on the Spurs (it's been Duncan and is now Kawhi) even when the national media hype train said he was the Spurs' best/most important player during their pace&amp;space makeover. Don't get me wrong, he's a HOF-caliber player, but he was *bad* this year and *awful* in the playoffs, and I'm not certain how much of it was due to injury/fatigue (or if he'll ever be consistently healthy). Plus, I don't think he has ever been that good on defense. I even think his career is overrated (I would take the unpopular stance that Ginobili has had a more impressive career). "
"681","Warriors","Wilt, Barry...Curry"
"682","Warriors","Does CP3 have cons though? I hate the dude but he's a straight baller"
"683","Warriors","&gt; We do I completely agree but in my opinion iggy can guard anyone klay can

In some places his D might even be better imo. but, what makes us elite is that we can put out a defensive juggernaut of a team that plays elite offense as well. we don't have anyone that can replace klay's D and not hurt our defense, which relies on versatile players."
"684","Warriors","yea that too, but also because of all the heart-attack inducing games from last year"
"685","Warriors","You're trippin'.

Warriors lost way too many games against sub-.500 teams last year, and the biggest reason for that is Mark Jackson.  Too often, he failed to take timeouts when the other team was on a run.  Too often, he didn't adjust the offense when something wasn't working.  And too often, Golden State's offense when the other team stops Curry.  We ran everything through him, and when his shooting and playmaking was off, we were fucked.

Bob Myers deserves a lot of credit for our 67 wins this year, due to bolstering the bench and keeping the same core group (rather than making some of the trades that were offered, like the Kevin Love trade).  But I might argue that the best move he made was hiring Steve Kerr.  Without him, I doubt we would've made it above 55 wins."
"686","Warriors","*in heat"
"687","Warriors","Curry/CP3 are interchangeable, Westbrook's pretty clearly a tier below"
"688","Warriors","True, he could stand to be a little more aggressive. Curry is a better shooter (best in league) and Russ is quicker, but those aren't exactly cons for him. He's still great in those areas just not as good as those two. "
"689","Warriors","I agree.  Kerr keeping our players on restricted minutes is a huge reason why the team has stayed so healthy.  People talk about ""luck"" but, as someone who works in big data, that explanation never sits well with me.

Another thing to keep in mind is that this is the first time that the Warriors have had to play this many games throughout the season.  I think that the Spurs stayed healthy last season due to minutes restriction, but all of those playoff runs finally took a toll on them (i.e. they made it to the WCF or better for like 3 years in a row).  The Warriors may face the same injury issues, despite minutes restriction, if they become perennial contenders like the Spurs."
"690","Warriors","Pistons systematically tore the Lakers apart with their lone win happening because Kobe had to hit a clutch shot at the end of game 2. No, it wasn't close."
"691","Warriors","Yeah but you can't try and argue that if you wanted to start a team with a player and go from there, the list wouldn't look something along the lines of Lebron, Steph, AD, KD, etc.  There's no way you put Harden or Blake on there before AD, at least in my opinion.  AD is already a phenomenal talent and he's just a kid."
"692","Warriors","I'm not trying to be condescending, so I'm sorry if I come off that way.  It's just clear to me that you're new to watching basketball and new to posting on /r/nba.  I've loved Steph's game since he was in Davidson, so I'm a HUGE fan.  But it's going to be very unlikely that he'll be in the conversation for Top 5 best players of all time.  So most people's answer to your question is going to be very predictable.

You're asking ""Who would you build your team around: a 27 year old point guard who won MVP for the first time in his life and is mostly known for his shooting and playmaking.... or a a 30 year old point-forward who has singlehandedly brought multiple teams to the Finals, can do it all (i.e. defend nearly every position, PLAY nearly every position, score, block, rebound, make plays, etc.), and has been awarded All-NBA, All-Defense, and MVP (4 times).  Curry may have a chance to beat LeBron offensively (and even if he could, it would still be close).  But he will never hold a candle to LeBron defensively.  If I'm a GM, I'm looking at the full package.

Edit: I swear to you that I really am trying to help.  Your first post ever is at 15% upvotes.  That means that an overwhelming number of people who have read it think it's a bad post.  If you want to make good posts, I suggest that you lurk more, learn more about basketball, and look up your question before posting it (because it has likely been asked before)."

"701","Warriors","I love how they weren't good enough for CoTY or DPoY or to have more than 2 all stars or to be seen as a top tier team last year with basically the same roster but all of a fucking sudden they're the greatest roster ever. "
"702","Warriors","Because I'm biased. Real answer though Westbrook is passionate almost to a fault. The only knock on him is that his mistakes are because he sometimes tries to put everything on himself. Curry is more efficient and flows with the game where he doesn't try too hard but when the time is right he makes the right decisions. This is all just my opinion though. "
"703","Warriors","Yeah always good to wear down your injured players before the game, right?"
"704","Warriors","He's the one who scouted Draymond and Ezeli too.  "
"705","Warriors","A: efficiency is important! Russ shot 4.5 3 pointers per game, and made them at a 29% rate. That's Josh Smith level bad, and it makes his team significantly worse. He's pretty bad at 2 pt attempts, too: 45.7%. Steph shot 44.3% from 3, and 52.8% for 2. The true shooting difference is stark: .638 vs. .536. This isn't a minor facet of the game, this is a huge deal. Curry's ridiculous efficiency stretches the defense and opens up the floor, creating a ton of open shots for his teammates. 

B: I would contend that literally the only thing Russ has on Curry is rebounding. Obviously Russ is the best short guy rebounder in basketball, no question. But look at turnovers: Russ had 4.6 per 36, Steph had 3.1. They're exactly even on steals per 36. Russ has the edge on assists, but only by 0.5, and GSW have 3-4 capable passers on the floor at all times, so he's not really the primary distributor.

C: I actually think Steph's a better defender than Westbrook. Advanced stats back me up. Westbrook had 3.2 defensive win shares, Steph with 4.1. In 2013-14, Westbrook had 2.3 vs. Curry's 4.0 -- Westbrook played 32 fewer games than Curry, but Curry was still on a better pace. The 2013-2014 numbers are really great to compare, because OKC and GSW had very similar defenses.  Traditional stats show that Curry and Westbrook are exactly equal on steals and blocks. I'm not sure where the myth of Westbrook as a great defender comes from, but he's really not.  

D: Curry is healthier, which counts as a plus."
"706","Warriors","Its mostly Gentry. Kerr is on record saying Gentry has forgotten more about offense than he's ever known, and while thats a bit of hyperbole it speaks volumes to Gentry's impact"
"707","Warriors","They also lied in the police report saying Thabo was blocking the crime scene and ran at them with his hands up when in the video he's clearly an entire block down the street from the stabbing and he got attacked from behind by police. 

They lied in their reports. Why would we take their word on anything else that happened? These guys would lie about anything to cover their asses. "

"715","Warriors","Let me know when another rebound gets talked about like this again. Warriors walked into Houstons house and ate their fucking dinner. Warriors looked hungry and the Rockets looked scared. This single rebound is a great summary of the game. Get some eye drops to help with the salt in your eyes. There's nothing lucky about it. The clippers besting the Spurs was lucky. "
"716","Warriors","The sad part is people will inevitably hate him for things like this, but none of it is his fault..."
"717","Warriors","Is that you, Magic?"
"718","Warriors","well you can't  put it in quotation  marks.  why did  you  get  downvoted? "
"719","Warriors","Dwight was one of the only guys actually trying last night, eventually everyone got demoralized as is expected."
"720","Warriors","Man, don't compare Jackson to Miller. Miller's a legitimate crazy person and a bit of a Nazi."
"721","Warriors","was chris bosh and/or Dwyane  wade injured in that series? "
"722","Warriors","Steph Curry. "
"723","Warriors","I remember this. I kept thinking, ""Wtf is going on?!"" Magic were a better team, but goddamn the Rockets played way better. "
"724","Warriors","Some of what you said is false, but he absolutely would not be anywhere near as effective in any other system. Hes a perfect fit in GS and GS is a perfect fit for him.

Hes worth the max to us, but if any other team pays him the max they will be overpaying, if that makes sense."
"725","Warriors","I may get downvoted, but I think it's because he didn't say ""I may get downvoted"""
"726","Warriors","curry missed 40 games in 2011-2012, and has missed a total of 10 games in the 3 seasons since (none of which were due to injury, just normal rest). Russ has missed 51 games in the past two seasons. Dude's had a bunch of knee problems and such, which, yeah, was caused by a collsion, but have recurred.

That's a minor point though. I'd take 82 games of Curry over 82 games of Westbrook in a heartbeat."
"727","Warriors","See every MVP ever "
"728","Warriors","That would be a crazy adventure. I'm looking in to that now."
"729","Warriors","Thanks for the response. Yeah from what I've heard logistically it may be a bit difficult to do. "
"730","Warriors","Ike Diogu. Ekpe Udoh. Anthony Randolph. surprising some of them are still in the league."
"731","Warriors","&gt;  ...moving to SF, a city that's becoming shitty 

Beg pardon?"
"732","Warriors","The NBA is shifting into a league where a PG who can't shoot 3pters (let alone shoot at all LOL) is a liability."
"733","Warriors","I recall Anthony Davis being a monster in one game and beating us.  Then being a monster again in the playoffs and it still wasn't enough.  If Lebron is the one thing the Warriors have to worry about, they will do everything they can to force him into tough shots.  Lebron will get his, but at what cost?  How many forced shots could have gone elsewhere?  The rest of the Cavs team needs to step up or Lebron will be busting his ass for nothing."
"734","Warriors","I don't think you understand basketball if you think Klay is the 2nd guy on the Warriors. He's the 2nd scorer, but he's probably the 4th most important player."
"735","Warriors","O_O"
"736","Warriors","I think the Warriors are capable. I'm not playing on the court so I don't know why you're hoping my thoughts change. 

Also, flair up, bitch. "
"737","Warriors","i backed my shit up with stats dude. If you think I'm wrong somewhere, tell me where."
"738","Warriors","That's called ""projection"". Might want to take a look in the mirror and figure your shit out"
"739","Warriors","There are some things bigger than trying to win a championship for one season. Like keeping the face of your franchise for the last 20 years on the team for his farewell tour."
"740","Warriors","Yeah, another name stolen from Curry.  Just like when the Hawks tried to call Korver threesus.  Lol yeah right.  "
"741","Warriors","Brings back bad memories of that shitshow 49ers vs Seahawks Thanksgiving game.  Was like the team had no desire to try, it was atrocious and of COURSE it was the first Niner game I got to go to in years."
"742","Warriors","Reddit politics in a nutshell"
"743","Warriors","Top 10? Lmao. I didn't know anyone was putting him outside of top 3."
"744","Warriors","Thanks buddy, right back atcha."
"745","Warriors","Because the modern day NBA is about spacing which he doesn't provide. His defense isn't THAT great. He can't hit free throws which means his only value which is driving isn't really usable. "
"746","Warriors","What? Of course not, why is that even a question?"
"747","Warriors","^ Dumb comment"
"748","Warriors","From who?"
"749","Warriors","I don't ""know"" that Lebron won't just magically lose all his ability to play basketball tonight either, but I'm pretty fucking confident predicting that it's not going to happen. Same shit with Rose. "
"750","Warriors","I feel like you're looking at this backwards, and it's really confusing me."
"751","Warriors","You should have said what does CP3 have to do to be better than Curry. This thread title about the MVP seems wrong. How is the best player this year not the best at their position?"
"752","Warriors","It's not a fucking circlejerk you overly-defensive babies. Go look at his fucking numbers for the playoffs, THEY ARE NOT GOOD."
"753","Warriors","Yep.

1. Dylan
2. Dylan
3. Dylan"
"754","Warriors","It's hard to tell obviously, but it looked to me like the cops weren't all on the same page in terms of getting him where they wanted him. It seemed like in the moment before they took him to the ground and broke his leg, some of the cops were pulling him one way and some the other way, and they may have interpreted that opposing pull as resistance by Thabo, when in fact he they were basically playing tug of war with him. It seemed like that was what led to them freaking out and throwing him to the ground and hitting him with a baton"
"755","Warriors","we were starting three rookies, 2 because of injuries in that series against the Nuggets. "
"756","Warriors","LOLOL I called rubio and flynn huge busts especially compared to steph curry and all the other great guards that came out of that draft. And this t'wolves fan proceeded to get extremely butt hurt and try to explain to me why Rubio is not a bust."
"757","Warriors","Let's look at Derrick Rose's shooting lines for the Bulls-Cavs series.

11-26, 6-20, 10-26, 11-23, 7-24, 7-16.

So he pretty clearly alternated between decent and awful efficiency throughout the series. Not sure what the fuck else you'd call a 6-20 line."
"758","Warriors","Someone is jealous of teams creating 3-point shots through penetration..."
"759","Warriors","makes total sense"
"760","Warriors","&lt;snarky response like ""Because this."" linked to an image of Lebron&gt;

&lt;""Never count out a team with Lebron.""&gt;

&lt;""Playoff experience.""&gt;

"
"761","Warriors","Are you a rabsho alt or are you talking about terrance ross? "
"762","Warriors","Warriors defense is good but not great? They're no.1 in the league. "
"763","Warriors","
&gt;Draymond Green. I've seen people (probably Warrior dickriders in retrospect) rank that big mouthed clown above players like Melo, Kobe, and PG13 and rave his 3 point game is on par with Klay and Steph, which is beyond horseshit.

Can you give us a source? I've never seen anyone claim anything close to this."
"764","Warriors","I remember seeing that Ike Diogu pick and being super confused. What ever happened to him?  "
"765","Warriors","Definitely. His defense, decision making and finishing around the rim have all made huge leaps"
"766","Warriors","No, but Al Horford, Pero Antic and George Teague all look somewhat different tonight, for some reason. Especially Antic, who appears to have gained 30 pounds while sitting in a tanning bed for the past 24 hours."
"767","Warriors","At least I can grasp the difference between ""principal"" and ""principle"" though"
"768","Warriors","That play happened in the second quarter when we were up like 10..."
"769","Warriors","BABY WON'T YOU COME MY WAYYYAYAY"
"770","Warriors","Well, the WCF were at least competitive before last night's ass-kicking, but Atlanta's looked discombobulated throughout the postseason, even before most of the injuries. I'm not really sure why."
"771","Warriors","I think what's really understated in this conversation is the depth the Warriors's have. When you have someone like Iguodala who can be fresh coming off the bench to guard the best player on the floor then that gives you a huge advantage. If the Kevin Love trade happens, you lose a lot of that depth I think. "
"772","Warriors","Jesus. What does he weigh, 1000 pounds?"
"773","Warriors","http://i5.tinypic.com/7y7zv3t.gif"
"774","Warriors","I'm an A's fan...so I'm even okay with having a best of 15 finals this year"
"775","Warriors","Just wanna interject and say that's tracking, not kerning. "
"776","Warriors","And Curry is the fucking MVP of the team and the league and it'll likely be largely because Steph MOTHERFUCKING Curry is on the team.  "
"777","Warriors","Read op"
"778","Warriors","Love &amp; Basketball"
"779","Warriors","Arguably? Consistently discriminatory housing practices that actually harmed the lives of dozens of black and latino families is unquestionably worse than getting mad at his girlfriend for posting a selfie with Magic Johnson. We are just way more comfortable as a society condemning racist words than racist actions"
"780","Warriors","I got $600 on this game, don't let me down Cavs!"
"781","Warriors","Sorry, but what is that from?"
"782","Warriors","Just last night he out rebounded Dwight Howard, so he's definitely top 5 rebounder at his position. "
"783","Warriors","Dwight Howard has never not had a kid when going bareback (17-0)"
"784","Warriors","Exactly, condemning Sterling was completely non-controversial because it was a matter of labeling one guy a racist for saying some indefensibly racist things, and then we could all congratulate ourselves for standing up to racism. Most Americans are totally comfortable with condemning personal, explicit racism like that. Institutional, systemic racism, by far the more important and damaging kind, is a different story. Many Americans still refuse to believe that it exists, so they will get all pissy if they see their favorite sports talking heads acknowledge it and talk about it."
"785","Warriors","I believe there were still ruins of 15+ in those games. You guys also had those types of runs though, courtesy of James harden step backs, closing the gap"
"786","Warriors","Sweet thanks man"
"787","Warriors","I mean, IMO it's MJ and Lebron on tier 1, and then the rest.  Obviously it's hard to compare across different eras yada yada, but those two are just a step above in terms of how they change the teams they're on.  I think Lebron will easily go down as the GOAT when it's all said and done.  The dude is only 30."
"788","Warriors","Whats with NBA players dressing like puritans? I've now seen at least TT, CP3, Harden, Melo, and LeBron wearing ridiculous hats and shirts with preacher collars. I understand pushing the limits of fashion and wanting to be on the leading edge of a new style, but they look hilariously bad."
"789","Warriors","If you like a book series with no ending..."
"790","Warriors","Plus there's the added problem that when misconduct does get reported (usually by witnesses these days, or because someone died and that's harder to cover up), the people prosecuting the officers are the same people who rely on them and work side by side with them in their normal work prosecuting the people these officers arrest. Of course they're not going to be impartial in those situations, that's just human nature."
"791","Warriors","His wiki says he's playing in the CBA. He will most likely be remembered for this picture http://imgur.com/luMXXDP"
"792","Warriors","SF is actually becoming the opposite of shitty.  But we can still hate on it because fuck SF.  "
"793","Warriors","You clearly don't watch much ESPN"
"794","Warriors","His lowest point total was 3 in his second season, he had 5 assists and 3 rebounds in 17 minutes.

I'd say his worst game ever was from his rookie year when he scored 9 points, grabbed 2 rebounds, made 5 assists, but committed 5 turnovers as well.

Pretty much every game that he scored less than 15 points, hes had over 10 ast+rebs combined without a ton of turnovers, and many were on few minutes (so maybe he left with injury or the games were blowouts)"
"795","Warriors","You should ask yourself why that is. "
"796","Warriors","3 wins in 56 years isnt a dynasty "
"797","Warriors","Haha"
"798","Warriors","""If it bleeds, we can kill it."" 

-Hawks"
"799","Warriors","One of Draymond's nicknames is Day Day, and he's hellla black"

"802","Warriors","They should sub Pop in for Bud."
"803","Warriors","Based Mozgov with the jumper"
"804","Warriors","uhh you miss the end of game 2? "
"805","Warriors","That's why I said dynasty of the last few years.  3 in 5 to be exact."
"806","Warriors","3 in 5 is"
"807","Warriors","If it happens Rocket fans gonna scream for hacking rule change even louder"
"808","Warriors"," he was able to take davidson to the elite 8, youre wrong"
"809","Warriors","Yea so for those wondering, I can't get the Internet to work on my laptop, but I'm working on it.

EDIT: NOT LOOKING PROMISING RIGHT NOW, SORRY GUYS
"
"810","Warriors","Hopefully sweep the Cavs and we become arguably a top 5 team all time"
"811","Warriors","Cavs playing like shit"
"812","Warriors","Well well well..."
"813","Warriors","/s?"
"814","Warriors","All they need to do is win four games. Just like when the series started!"
"815","Warriors","I guess I'm in touch with my inner child. Sour grapes for the rest. It's also funny because it's kinda true. "
"816","Warriors","If you guys were 100% you wouldn't be saying the same thing "
"817","Warriors","no because with the cap going up players will ask for more money  

"

"820","Warriors","I hear he was at a club with Drake last night."
"821","Warriors","Jr Swish"
"822","Warriors","They are just missing shots. Not getting out played."
"823","Warriors","Well then don't bitch about rest "
"824","Warriors","Worst game to bet on them. the line is heavily inflated. Atlanta is the play today. I am assuming you played -8.5 or -9."
"825","Warriors","Oh shittt The Matrix"
"826","Warriors","Bron pistons mode unlocked"
"827","Warriors","steph shot 58% vs beverley this year. went for 27 and 34. but sure lol."
"828","Warriors","Nit sure why you are getting down voted the guy is a horrible sports journalist "
"829","Warriors","It's not amazing, but it's certainly effective."
"830","Warriors","haha, webber calling out Reggie for his leg kicks while shooting"
"831","Warriors","Curry had a better year this year. His career won't overshadow lebrons but you can't take this year away from him."
"832","Warriors","LOL. ""Reggie your career meant nothing."" "
"833","Warriors","Green will be restricted free agent, so he'll be locked up unless the FO is unwilling to match offers, which I think is unlikely."
"834","Warriors","What's if both teams are a 100%?"
"835","Warriors","Hi I'm here for the funeral"
"836","Warriors","Schroeder's such a lazy fuck. "
"837","Warriors","Before even this season, Klay was in no way considered an all-star - quite a few people got mad bout not trading him for KLove and then he comes in this season and plays some spectacular basketball that was significantly elevated from last year."
"838","Warriors","bazemore is still shit on offense. now i remember why he couldnt get on the floor with us."
"839","Warriors","Lakers Championship confirmed for next year. There are people that brag about having the big dick and everyone knows they're full of shit. Mitch is not one of those guys. You better believe he's whipping it out this offseason and fucking free agency and trade options in its ass. "
"840","Warriors","Not hating on the king at all right now, but maybe LBJ shouldn't have been toying with the Hawks last game and start taking this series more seriously."
"841","Warriors","[karma?](https://streamable.com/rwds)"
"842","Warriors","#**\#MATH**"
"843","Warriors","I'm almost 100% sure Randle's got short arms, a la Zach Randolph and Blake Griffin. "
"844","Warriors","Anyone ever injure a teammate in warm ups or practice before? A teammate of mine broke another's nose during warmups. Lesson is, make sure the guy you're passing to knows you're passing it to him lol. Balls to faces hurt."
"845","Warriors","yeah, that was probably a bit much. I'd put Lebron, Curry, and Harden on the same tier though."
"846","Warriors","He's saying that creating a play for the 3-point shot is wrong, wheras teams such as the Warriors and Hawks penetrate for the 3-point shot. So they play for the 3, even though they do use penetration to do so."
"847","Warriors","The east looks so bad right now. 

edit - lol dont even know why I'm getting downvoted. Cavs are shooting 22% right now and the Hawks have been shitting the bed most of the series."
"848","Warriors","When was this? Lol I met him last year. I guess he's calmed down since. But on the flip side, he doesn't really owe you anything. Plus he was eating so if he signed your autograph then more people would have come up to him. He deserves personal time like any other. "
"849","Warriors","You guys must be going crazy for this Cavs team. If I wasn't a Warriors fan I would definitely be rooting for Lebron to bring home a chip, but I am so screw you guys and your godlike superstar"
"850","Warriors","When if comes from Mr Downey Ultra Soft himself, you know it's bad. He was a beast in the first quarter even though he was out witted by Bogut's savvy on a couple plays and targeted by a few of the Dubs set plays. "
"851","Warriors","and this season lost 7 out of 7 games vs golden state"
"852","Warriors","I feel like I explained it pretty well. The offensive system in place is mostly Gentry's. "
"853","Warriors","It's so dope to see him in the playoffs contributing to a team, taking interviews and whatnot. "
"854","Warriors","Yes. "
"855","Warriors","Playing like a potato in sandals."
"856","Warriors","Cavs still have Kyrie though.. He hasn't been playing."
"857","Warriors","otto porter bad"
"858","Warriors","we taking this in one half fam.

edit - can't even joke in here I guess. Maybe if I had a Utah Jazz flair."
"859","Warriors","well through 1 quarter of play you might be wrong on points! currently LBJ is 0/10 haha"
"860","Warriors","LelBron doing work! Don't worry Kyrie, he'll throw a game or two for you"
"861","Warriors","the CAVS seem to be a bit flustered, know one really knows where to go and they all taking ok shots"
"862","Warriors","wut de fukk"
"863","Warriors","wouldnt matter. curry shot 58% vs beverley earlier in the year. "
"864","Warriors","That was a travel by Bron. Cmon Refs. "
"865","Warriors","Honestly there's nothing wrong with your post and I'm not even trying to be a homer here. The East just doesn't look strong at all."
"866","Warriors","Scott looks like a mini Kenyon Martin. "
"867","Warriors"," Okay,  so they had 2.5 of their big 3 as opposed to 1.5"
"868","Warriors","but it wasnt it was 3 world championships in 56 years. look it up"
"869","Warriors","Cleveland is a football town. "
"870","Warriors","Doesn't that mean he did great? I'll see myself out. "
"871","Warriors","Lebron with Legrimace"
"872","Warriors","lebron trying to travel his way to the finals"
"873","Warriors","ya missed the point haha"
"874","Warriors","hes saying steph is elite because of the warriors system. its not the system its steph, who literally made davidson elite by putting them on his back"
"875","Warriors","Went to a Browns game a few years back, y'all know how to get drunk. "
"876","Warriors","Good thing Steph didn't give him any either. Guy would have tried to sap his powers "
"877","Warriors","Downtown Bars are probably rocking though. "
"878","Warriors","He's taller and wider and maybe just as fast as MJ, and after MJ bulked up he could handle the Pistons. Maybe it wouldn't have been as easy as it is now but he could have played ball against them just fine."
"879","Warriors","Are we ever gonna find out what the fuck they're shooting at in the Last Ship?"
"880","Warriors","Horford has the softest hands ever.  He should try out for the Falcons.../r/NFL will go nuts. "
"881","Warriors","And then a year later Rick Barry gets upset and refuses to shoot for the second half of game 7 of the WCF. GS would probably have another championship if not for that, we were the heavy favorite."

"
"883","Warriors","Dude sold that like he got blown up in an NFL block."
"884","Warriors","On offense? Ehhh..."
"885","Warriors","1. Klay
2. Conley 
3. Beal (great overall showing in the playoffs)
4. Bosh when healthy
5. Blake Griffin

No particular order

It's only an opinion. Relax lol"
"886","Warriors","Dunleavy?"
"887","Warriors","Still a shitty call though, it was a solid screen."
"888","Warriors","At a road game, I scored the first 8 points vs our rival high school to go up 8-0 to start the game. I had a lot of friends attending the rival school and they started chanting ""JOEL YOU SUCK! JOEL YOU SUCK!"". It was not in the least bit mean spirited, just awesome competition with cool friends. They ended up beating us handily but for one glorious moment, the gym was loud with the sound of rivalry and it was awesome.
Someone went streaking that same game for my runner up best moment."
"889","Warriors","Damnit Atlanta we had an agreement this winter. "
"890","Warriors","Pickup game (all I've ever played). I'm bringing the ball up on the right side of the court--slowly because I'm not a good dribbler and frankly you don't usually want me bringing the ball up. I see my big man running up the left side of the court. I throw a perfect bounce pass all the way across the court, in front of my man and behind his, to hit him in stride. He scores the layup. People say ""how the fuck did you make that pass?"""
"891","Warriors","I don't consider Russ a #2 after this year. It's his team until Durant shows he's capable of being Durant again after the injury. Kyrie can replace Beal probably, but I wanted to give that kid some love. He played his ass off in the playoffs "
"892","Warriors","Delly's such a bitch. "
"893","Warriors","THATS MY BOY HORFORD THROWING BOWS UP IN THIS BITCH 

"
"894","Warriors","Horford 😭😭"

"896","Warriors","&gt; No particular order"
"897","Warriors","Just different opinions,  that's all."
"898","Warriors","Bullshit. Delly undercut him. "
"899","Warriors","Can you smell what Al Horford is cooking?"
"900","Warriors","Hawks should put in a scrub to dive at Bron's knees.  Delly's antics will stop immediately. "
"901","Warriors","""NOT IN MY HOUSE"" You totally yelled that every single time didn't you, you beast!! That's awesome."
"902","Warriors","Delly is that old guy in the gym who couldn't really play but you're aware of him at all times since he might barrel into you because of how awkward he is.
"
"903","Warriors","Conley absolutely, but replacing Beal w/ Kyrie seeks fair. "
"904","Warriors","You can only accidentally fall into players lower legs so many times. "
"905","Warriors","It's his angled eyebrows."
"906","Warriors","Is it wrong that I like Reggie Miller more the C Webb right now?

Delly going for legs 3 different times in 2 series. "
"907","Warriors","If he tries that in the Finals, he needs to have his teeth knocked out."
"908","Warriors","DJ Strawberry has to be in the discussion"
"909","Warriors","Fuck I missed what happened."
"910","Warriors","Oh man, reasonable comment from a cavs fan! Thank you. "
"911","Warriors","Can anyone hear what the fans were saying"
"912","Warriors","I can't believe TNT broadcast even showed the Dellevedova diving for the ball and korver being hurt and the commentators compared this to what Horford did right now. That's ridiculous. 

not saying horford did this completely on purpose, but he clearly didn't ""lose his balance"""
"913","Warriors","On Delly."
"914","Warriors","delly m8 "
"915","Warriors","That shows favoritism towards one team which I do have a problem with. Injuries are part of the game and every team has to deal with it. The NBA cares about money and if casual fans stop watching because of a longer break they will move the dates up no matter what. They aren't going to favor one team over the other because of an injury. Yeah it sucks but that's the way it is. "
"916","Warriors","Lemme ask you somethin Reggie"
"917","Warriors","I wouldn't. I'd like my player to actually play a full season. "
"918","Warriors","Yeah, no one is talking about this. That was textbook box out and Steph's right arm is in a perfectly legitimate position.  Actually if you watch the angle from the baseline, his left arm is also being brought up by Dwight before he extends it to grab the rebound.  

The person really at fault here is  Harden for backing away from the play instead of following the ball. When he sees that Steph actually has it, he then backs up one more step as Curry goes up for the layup and Dwight fouls him. "
"919","Warriors","Except for the part where he's rolled right into two guys' legs."
"920","Warriors","While Draymond has called it Curry's team based on his actions, Curry has called Dray the vocal leader of the team.  Something that Steph doesn't do."
"921","Warriors","You can read, can't you?"
"922","Warriors","WOW."
"923","Warriors","HIs career true shooting percentage is 52.5%. Westbrook is a lot of things but he's not an efficient scorer"
"924","Warriors","""But first let's ask Steve Javie's dumb ass"""
"925","Warriors","daaaaang ATL is f*cked"
"926","Warriors","HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HORFORD OMFG LOL 


SORRY HAWKS LMFAO     "
"927","Warriors","That is trash. What the hell man"
"928","Warriors","League office says, ""YOU GET LEBRON IN THE FINALS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY"" "
"929","Warriors","Oh... Bye Hawks. See you next postseason."
"930","Warriors","Okay then, after that it's dive at Lebron's knee until he can't walk anymore. If they wanna be the Isiah Thomas Pistons, two will play at that game."
"931","Warriors","I mean I'd call that bulls style given how they put together their first dynasty. Hopefully that shows how farcical this is."
"932","Warriors","You right. I have short term memory loss "
"933","Warriors","That's turrible"
"934","Warriors","Dude pushes off with both feet halfway into the scrum. 

 It's dirty as Fuck. "
"935","Warriors","wow are you fucking kidding me? let them play its the fucking eastern conference finals. really? "
"936","Warriors","What if he beat his mom? Reddit would literally kill him"
"937","Warriors","Home cooking "
"938","Warriors","so much bullshit"
"939","Warriors","This is ridiculous."
"940","Warriors","Delly looks like he could any one of us fans sitting on our couches watching the game eating potato chips. I can easily see him with a beer belly. The Delly Belly."
"941","Warriors","That's not what I saw on either replay."
"942","Warriors","dont worry! you'll get an official apology from adam silver tomorrow saying it should not have been a flagrant two! that will solve everything.... "
"943","Warriors","Dellavedova pushed off the ground before he went into Horford, that dude is earning his dirty reputation. "
"944","Warriors","Yep. Those Knicks Pacers series from the mid-90s wouldn't be able to be finished now. You would have no players left. They would all be ejected and suspended. It's ridiculous now. "
"945","Warriors","Fuck that. Put a bullseye on Bron. That will stop the antics real fucking quick. "
"946","Warriors","Here's why its a flagrant 2. Horford dragged Delly down, and then clearly fell down on him; watching the replay he didn't lose his balance. 

"
"947","Warriors","unbelievable"
"948","Warriors","No pun intended. "
"949","Warriors","... I like Lebron, and I like the rest of the Cavs....  
But it seems like Dellavedova is always involved in these controversial plays and calls. "
"950","Warriors","Nah, he'd rather come on here and bitch about it."
"951","Warriors","Refs hands are tied. Dropping an elbow is an ejection. "
"952","Warriors","Here's why its a flagrant 2. Horford dragged Delly down, and then clearly fell down on him; watching the replay he didn't lose his balance. Also the elbow to the head factors in. 

You can say its debatable,  but you can't say its a ridiculous call. "
"953","Warriors","I'm fine with the tough guy act but don't be surprised when you get an elbow in the face and you for damn sure better not be looking for a foul afterwards. "
"954","Warriors","And if he tries to fuck up your ankle and causes you to fall onto him? Seems like a double ejection would've been the way to go."
"955","Warriors","You can only accidentally do it so many time. "
"956","Warriors","Wow, I've seen way worse fouls that got less severe punishments. I usually try to reason why some ""bad calls"" were justified but this one is just plain old stupid, and the refs are actual boneheads to have made that call."
"957","Warriors","Okay then, I missed that angle. Looks like you're right."
"958","Warriors","yeah yeah excessive contact and this and that, still bullshit"
"959","Warriors","Because he's a competitor and you're not."
"960","Warriors","He gathered and drove into horford (going for the knees or not) as he was falling down. Going for an injury/specifically for the knees, maybe maybe not, but he definitely knew what he was doing."
"961","Warriors","He just hustles. I don't think at all he has clear intent to injure"
"962","Warriors","Imagine if it was Lebron getting ejected. wooooooweeeeee"
"963","Warriors","I won't include him due to injury. The players on the court this year are the ones I'm going with. Who cares anyways? I'm eating a burrito while vaping and watching the game. Not much is going into this other than fun thought. "
"964","Warriors","Delly might be dirty but he got dragged down and then Horford elbowed him. Super clean cut call. "
"965","Warriors","He gathered and thrust himself into horford as he was falling down, watch the replay."
"966","Warriors","We'd be swimming in salt."
"967","Warriors","He intentionally elbowed the other dude. Should've been a flagrant 1, but the refs decided it was a flagrant 2 foul which is an automatic ejection."
"968","Warriors","two (fairly weak) flagrant 2s given in favor of the Cavs, both involving Delly. I guess it goes with the letter (rules) of the sport, but it goes against the spirit of the sport. I'm a little surprised but the officials did take a long time with both, so I guess it's more likely the right calls than not"
"969","Warriors","This ain't minor. Hordord went WWE with the elbow"
"970","Warriors","Delly was going down normally, but he pushed off with his foot once he realized what was going on."
"971","Warriors","[Alternate angle](https://i.imgur.com/qnVZEnf.gif)"
"972","Warriors","yeah right he basically launched himself into Horford."
"973","Warriors","So many chin straps in Cleveland doe."
"974","Warriors","Yes. Basketball Fan flair."
"975","Warriors","Holy fuck dude. Overreacting much?"
"976","Warriors","You're a fucking moron"
"977","Warriors","To me, I see their arms are a bit tangled up, but I don't see Horford pulling him down. I see Delly simply falling down."
"978","Warriors","I agree with this. Shooting for his knee/trying to injure him, probably not, but he was definitely intentionally launching his body into Horford."
"979","Warriors","you can't go landing on peoples ankles either, bro."
"980","Warriors","ABORT, ABORT"
"981","Warriors","nice flair. you can watch it yourself, that's what OPs link is for."
"982","Warriors","Slamming down a tomahawk dunk is still only worth 2 points when you have the best 3 pt shooter in the game raining down on you..."

"987","Warriors","That's why Ernie gets the big bucks. "
"988","Warriors","Got held by Horford and then Delly pushed off with both feet into Horfords knees.  That's uncalled for.  Go rewatch it. "
"989","Warriors","thanks must have missed it"
"990","Warriors","lol they gon start brawling on the TNT set"
"991","Warriors","Terrible reasoning. ""He didn't elbow him in the back of the head so it should be a flagrant 1."""
"992","Warriors","#\#YOUREMADASFUCKRIGHTNOW"
"993","Warriors","He got pulled down, then rolled onto Horford's leg as he ran up the floor, causing him to fall, which he did elbow-first on purpose."
"994","Warriors","His fellow Aussie is going to give him a few hard screens to start the series, should we advance."
"995","Warriors","One time is an accident (Taj), two times is a coincidence (Korver), three times is a pattern (Horford)."
"996","Warriors","Watch MLS!"
"997","Warriors","3 games into this series and I'm yet to see that impact...."
"998","Warriors","The thing about these accidents is that it's the same guy involved in them and it always seems it's costing the other team a player. Dellavedova might need to reconsider his play style if this keeps happening."
"999","Warriors","Blake and Randle have normal wingspans, i.e. same as their height vs. the abnormal proportions in NBA players.

Randalph has long arms, that is why he could  gobble up those rebounds without leaving the floor.

"
"1000","Warriors","C'mon man, sure he is boxing out at first I'll give him that, but he literally pushes off on both feet and is airborne, launching into Horford and landing on his feet."
"1001","Warriors","unbiased in this, clear flagrant 2. bye!"
"1002","Warriors","he looked at his bottom right direction before he planned to sit on Delly ..that was on purpose   #nohomo "
"1003","Warriors","Does he realize his team is down 2-0. He was playing well too. Holy fuck. "
"1004","Warriors","cause obvious bias? I'm a Warriors fan by the way if that makes me less of a bitch in your eyes"
"1005","Warriors","That Intel guy is annoying as fuck."
"1006","Warriors","Forreal, I'm legit worried about that fool..."
"1007","Warriors","we've been rebuilding for like two decades...all those lottery picks. This is definitely not normal"
"1008","Warriors","He launches himself into Horford on the way down. Not saying he was going for a knee or trying to injure him (looked like he was going more for his shoulder into the Al's hip), but he did more than just ""fall down"""
"1009","Warriors","He was told after the 2nd Seattle game. "
"1010","Warriors","didn't kobe or his agent say he wouldn't play for anyone other than LA?"
"1011","Warriors","This is evidence of the damage an awful commentator can do. If Reggie hadn't started all this bullshit the narrative would not be happening this way. "
"1012","Warriors","Someone born 6-10 years ago."
"1013","Warriors","It was fine until he pushed off at the end and then went into Horford."
"1014","Warriors","Watch the replay. He clearly launches himself into Horford (more towards Al's hip), but you're delusional if you think he is just falling."
"1015","Warriors","They thought it was halftime and that they were in the locker room. "
"1016","Warriors","Both. I think it should have been flagrant 1s on both Horford and Dellavedova, but I'm done complaining."
"1017","Warriors","Didn't you know that he played rugby once when he was like 6? Makes him literally the toughest guy in the NBA."
"1018","Warriors","Delly set his feet and then pushed off. "
"1019","Warriors","If anyone wants it full speed, if you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmznHPMBwss) video at 1.5x speed at around 33 seconds in, it looks pretty much full speed.

I don't know if you can speed things up on streamable and if you can, I couldn't figure it out."
"1020","Warriors","McAdoo tho"
"1021","Warriors","Delly rolls into legs pretty purposefully. It doesn't look accidental at all. "
"1022","Warriors","I didn't say horford shouldn't be ejected, I'm saying Delly isn't innocent."
"1023","Warriors","I'm recording the game and replayed that sequence several times. Horford had Delly by the left shoulder and dragged him down. 

Horford and I guess the rest of the team are sensitive to Delly's aggression on defense, especially due to the injury to Korver.


With that in mind, Delly singlehandedly took out 2 Atlanta all stars from the rest of the series."
"1024","Warriors","I'm not disagreeing, but it's obviously a highly controversial call within the context of each definition both degrees of flagrant fouls. The refs took multiple viewings before remotely being able to all agree on the call, it seemed like one just finally caved in to agree with the others for time's sake. The announcers and the halftime crew, as well as this thread, and probably all groups of people watching this game can't stop talking over each other about the play.    
  
The shitty thing is that it makes us realize the Korver play/injury should have been called the same way. "
"1025","Warriors","The Atlanta Hawks have been [un]officially eliminated from the playoffs."
"1026","Warriors","Are you not seeing him launch his body into Horford? Are you blind? 

I'm not saying Horford is innocent and shouldn't be ejected, I'm saying Delly isn't as innocent is as you're saying he is."
"1027","Warriors","Delly covered a lot of ground in Horford's direction for someone who is supposedly just falling. It seems that the subreddit has spoken, but I see Reggie's point."
"1028","Warriors","Probably, which is why I don't watch sitcoms."
"1029","Warriors","Give me a break. That shit happens when people go to the ground. There is no evidence he tried to do anything other than people being upset at the result.

Reggie right now is making no sense at all. ""He's not a dirty player but you can't go at a guy's legs"". "
"1030","Warriors","Delly covered a lot of ground in Horford's direction for someone who is supposedly just falling. You can see Delly driving his legs in Horford's direction, looking to create contact with Horford's legs. It seems that the subreddit has spoken, but I see Reggie's point."
"1031","Warriors","I get that view, but let me ask, if he had 5 more previous instances of similar questionably dirty plays, would your view of this play be different?"
"1032","Warriors","Not adequate. "
"1033","Warriors","I get that view, but let me ask, if he had 5 more previous instances of similar questionably dirty plays, would your view of this play be different?

"
"1034","Warriors","so kerr told steph a bunch of stuff and now hes the mvp? lol"
"1035","Warriors","I get that view, but let me ask, if he had 5 more previous instances of similar questionably dirty plays, would your view of this play be different?"
"1036","Warriors","So did Taj Gibson pull Delly down too? "
"1037","Warriors","If he dies, he was probably your favorite character. - GRRM "
"1038","Warriors","Yeah, he's good enough, but I think he's gotta see this team blossom for a bit. He's already had a HC stint and said it's gonna take another special situation him to move: after hearing him rave about this group, I took it as he probably won't leave, but we will see. "
"1039","Warriors","delavedova better not try any of this dirty shit on curry"
"1040","Warriors","The NBA just needs to send a vague message to Delly saying ""ay, we watching you."" That's all"
"1041","Warriors","No, which is why he knows sketchy play when he sees it."
"1042","Warriors","He's pushing his legs into him like a running back would while fighting for extra yards. Give me a break. "
"1043","Warriors","I dunno about that. Dwight quieted down after the first half. It seemed like Brewer was the only one trying in the second."
"1044","Warriors","He had already tripped/was getting pulled away from that. He wasn't in danger of falling on him."
"1045","Warriors","OK smart guy, tell me how my opinion is wrong.  But before we start, here are some of your brilliant insights:

In comparison of LeBron vs. Curry/Harden.
&gt; It's not just true shooting and free throws and 3 pointers, they. Have a higher fg% as well. Yh but **defense is mostly overrated on this sub**, being a well rounded player is good but defense and offense are not weighted equally.

[In regards to a player's legacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3610ms/lebron_seeking_5_finals_in_a_row_hasnt_been_done/cr9yp1p):
&gt;**Rings are a big indicator in who's better though**.

[In regards to how good Anthony Davis is](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/331u8v/game_thread_8_new_orleans_pelicans_00_1_golden/cqgth2l):
&gt; I get what youre saying, but **you can't just gauge how good a player is from the regular season**. Obviously it's far too early in his playoff career to tell though."
"1046","Warriors","&gt;Will Miller ever shut the fuck up ~~about this~~?

I'm guessing no."
"1047","Warriors","My friend got an ACL rupture from what Delly did"
"1048","Warriors","He shouldn't be diving into other players legs. twice in two games is way too much."
"1049","Warriors","LMAO who edited Delly's wiki page?

http://imgur.com/uhqiKZk"
"1050","Warriors","exactly. We've drafted some great individual players. We've drafted a lot of awful players. All that doesn't matter, the team was never good, the coaching was never good, the ownership was never good. Just because you're rebuilding, even if you pick up some talent, doesn't mean you will become a 67 win team."
"1051","Warriors","I said if, I wasn't questioning previous plays, but okay, back to the game."
"1052","Warriors","I definitely don't want Dellavedova diving into Curry's legs that's for sure."
"1053","Warriors","I'm not sure why Nick Johnson isn't getting more (non blowout) playing time. I know he's a rookie and has looked kind of awkward out there running with the first team on offense, but he was Pac 12 1st team defense and is definitely athletic. I'm sure he stands a much better chance of keeping up with Curry than Grandpa Jason and Abuelo Pablo."
"1054","Warriors","I mean theres not much difference there. Hating a player for chewing a mouthpiece?"
"1055","Warriors","My mother thought Common was an actor named, ""John something"""
"1056","Warriors","Keeping a full head of hair has to be up there."
"1057","Warriors","What was that chant? It was dope"
"1058","Warriors","I don't think that at all. I just like Mikes overall game and leadership at this point over Kyrie. Not a knock on him "
"1059","Warriors","idc whether he's guilty or not, but the fact is he's been in too many incidents lately, just let him know they'll keep an eye on him. "
"1060","Warriors","Thanks, it was just so loud and on point! They usually do that? "
"1061","Warriors","Falling down is one thing but pushing further and rolling into people's leg is dirty. "
"1062","Warriors","That's a little cynical...Women don't just date people for money."
"1063","Warriors","If the game moves too fast for him then he shouldn't play with such reckless abandon. He's going to continue to hurt guys and after awhile he'll have a target on his back. It's a part of professionalism."
"1064","Warriors","lebron just fuckin around and hopping up the floor now. 

""fucked around and got a triple double"" "
"1065","Warriors","BOOOO"
"1066","Warriors","lol"
"1067","Warriors","We should all have the same opinions. "

"1070","Warriors","Soo are you saying it was intentional?"
"1071","Warriors","It really is bad offense right now. Ugh"
"1072","Warriors","Fisher and boozer have mirror image shots. Even more so because Fish is a lefty and Booz is right. High release and everything is a rainbow."
"1073","Warriors","It's basketball not football. I'm not the one on the court causing accidents. Are you like related to Dellavedova or something? You are really taking this kind of personal."
"1074","Warriors","That was murder by Lebron"
"1075","Warriors","Yeah but the Heat retired Jordan's jersey despite him playing there for only zero years."
"1076","Warriors","EVERYONE GETTING FUCKED UP"
"1077","Warriors","""It was accident"""
"1078","Warriors","Moore's a harmless, gentle hippie. Miller's a racist, sexist piece of shit. It's a bit different"
"1079","Warriors","If anything happens to Curry's legs, Draymond will start ""accidentally"" falling down onto Lebron's ankles."
"1080","Warriors","That's a fair assessment and I can see where you're coming from. I definitely think Delly is trying to jump into Horford (probably because Horford was pulling him), but I don't think he was intentionally trying to go for the knees/injure him. "
"1081","Warriors","Thanks for the info. It caught me off guard cause I mean our fans are loud but it's pretty much just generic stuff"
"1082","Warriors","Now I know why Reggie Miller is one of the greatest trash talkers in NBA history. 

Everything he's spouting is pure garbage. "
"1083","Warriors","If they win it'll be top 5 greatest days of my life. I would love for them to win a championship before they move. Parade better be in Oakland too."
"1084","Warriors","They're playing Thuggish Ruggish lol. Sick."
"1085","Warriors","It's tough to say -- defense is so hard to isolate. But I watch a lot of Warriors games, and I don't really agree with that. He just has a tremendous basketball IQ."
"1086","Warriors","Ok then I gotta ask you in your opinion was Horford deserving of a flagrant two?"
"1087","Warriors","Well I think a bit of that just has to do with him being on another level than the competition back then "
"1088","Warriors","That's a good attitude right there"
"1089","Warriors","looks like it to me. why is it so ridiculous ?"
"1090","Warriors","You'd love that smug face if he was wearing a silver and black jersey."
"1091","Warriors","Because after he pulled him down, Delly tried to roll over into his ankle/knee area, which is what caused him to fall. Should've been a double flagrant 2, imo."
"1092","Warriors","no regard for human life smh"
"1093","Warriors","Blast is like ""these fuckin' questions man..."""
"1094","Warriors","Sports interviewer might as well have said, ""Your star player is sucking ass and the rest are a bunch of a-holes. How do you feel about that?""

"1118","Warriors","Screaming lady in Memphis never gave up and they were down by 20."
"1119","Warriors","They might've fixed it in a recent update, but there was an update recently that screwed up fadeaways &amp; step-back jumpers out of the post- so that hit at about 105%, even with absolute garbage players. Shaun Livingston is probably the most unstoppable player at this because his matchup will never be able to contest.

Also, if the CPU takes a fadeaway jumper from the baseline behind the basket, the ball will arc to heaven itself, get blessed by Zeus and Jesus, and splash through the net soundlessly as your heart breaks into a million pieces

Him being more efficient than an average player isn't a good argument for him being efficient in the context of a comparison to elite players in the league. And why do you use ORTG? That's purely a team stat. By your logic Andrew Bogut is as ""efficient"" of a player as Westbrook."
"1179","Warriors","Carmelo Anthony had slightly more points and rebounds than Lebron did."
"1180","Warriors","Yeah. But I didn't really pay much attention to him as a warrior. But last year as a laker, he showed real potential. Happy to see him fitting in and doing well now."
"1181","Warriors","Oh my god "
"1182","Warriors","It was definitely both though. That was some prime, grade-A Warriors basketball right there, and even if Harden had been hitting shots and you guys had brought your A-game I think we still would have won, but the lack of effort from the Rockets was what allowed us to win by 35 points. I definitely saw some lazy defense, both in terms of getting back in transition and staying with guys off the ball, and the Warriors are built to punish that kind of defense. If you're on Steph and you're hanging out ball-watching, more than likely that'll cost you three points"
"1183","Warriors","Can't believe they didn't hold it to run the clock out"
"1184","Warriors","Wow James showing off his insane athleticism by going for the steal and then getting right back on defense .5 seconds later. That was nuts."
"1185","Warriors","LBJ will be the GOAT one day but cmon man, get your ass back on D"
"1186","Warriors","Lebron, don't cry on the ground. "
"1187","Warriors","Scott pulled a Barngani"
"1188","Warriors","Warriors ones were large "
"1189","Warriors","TT earning the moneu"
"1190","Warriors","Wtf is this"
"1191","Warriors","""SHUT THE FUCK UP CLEVELAND"" - Lebron james.

Scumbag literally just said that I heard him.

Edit - note to self: bad jokes are bad.

Edit 2 - pile it on me /r/NBA I'm rdy."
"1192","Warriors","Can't believe Lebron didn't get back on D"
"1193","Warriors","Come on Hawks, let's make this an interesting series.  Close it out strong."
"1194","Warriors","At least it's a good game!"
"1195","Warriors","Paul Millsap step back mid range at the buzzer "
"1196","Warriors","BasedGod with the game winning  3.

Lil B with the blessing."
"1197","Warriors","Yeah that made no sense"
"1198","Warriors","YES"
"1199","Warriors","That's why I'll never think of Lebron as a true great. Too much of a baby."
"1200","Warriors","Bazemore for the game winner! "
"1201","Warriors","Gonna root for a Bazemore put back dunk for the win. "
"1202","Warriors","IN BEFORE PHANTOM CALL ON CLE"
"1203","Warriors","3 times in the span of 6 games he takes out players by the knees or the ankles.  It's a pattern. "
"1204","Warriors","Yessss overtime is the only thing I wanted out of that last minute."
"1205","Warriors","Imagine Wiggins, but about ten times better. "
"1206","Warriors","That was the last play?"
"1207","Warriors","Shoulda took it to the cup"
"1208","Warriors","What the hell was that"
"1209","Warriors","I feel like the Hawks could've got a better shot off there."
"1210","Warriors","How the fuck is Bud the coach of the year?  "
"1211","Warriors","Free basketball!"
"1212","Warriors","A pull up 3 going left.

What the heck?"
"1213","Warriors","Wow.  People at Buffalo Wild Wings must be loving this. "
"1214","Warriors","Dude looks exactly the same now at 30 and at 18."
"1215","Warriors","Not sure about that playcall."
"1216","Warriors","That last play of regulation. Uhhhhhh....."
"1217","Warriors","the fuck was that? they just needed 2 to win."
"1218","Warriors","And the Hawks just lost with a prolonged 5 mins."
"1219","Warriors","Because you brought up Durant first "
"1220","Warriors","wow"
"1221","Warriors","I'll take another round please"
"1222","Warriors","I feel like ATL could have drawn up something better than that. "
"1223","Warriors","what a terrible fucking last shot, playing safe instead of trying to actually win, atl is cooked"
"1224","Warriors","O.T. GENESIS!!!"
"1225","Warriors","They weren't running shit...there was zero off ball moment other than the high screen"
"1226","Warriors","Dellevadova is such a weasel fuck "
"1227","Warriors","no 1 can step 2 lebron lol"
"1228","Warriors","What"
"1229","Warriors","Maybe the Hawks were counting on the Cavs defending a drive to the rim so they chose to shoot? Idk. Kinda like the Super Bowl ending"
"1230","Warriors","There isn't one, LeBron was pushing through the screen."
"1231","Warriors","tough shot? tough shit."
"1232","Warriors","bro its strategy ok"
"1233","Warriors","My point exactly. "
"1234","Warriors","ur mum gettn punded"
"1235","Warriors","Yeah, that was odd.  I'm surprised that's the best thing that Coach Bud drew out of the timeout.  They could've cleared some space to drive into the paint with a few screens or passes.  Could've turned into a mid-range pullup or (less likely) a layup."
"1236","Warriors","Hey, it works for some players..."
"1237","Warriors","finish this one out bron"
"1238","Warriors","That was a terrible play to be honest."
"1239","Warriors","Hmmm. Dan Quinn is to Pete as Budenlolzer is to Pop?"
"1240","Warriors","Yes. "
"1241","Warriors","I noticed it too. It's the type of thing you don't always notice right away but every team does it."
"1242","Warriors","What other options do you have?"
"1243","Warriors","LeCramp!!!"
"1244","Warriors","""Get away from me Delly all you do is hurt people"" - Lebron James

Yup heard him definitely say that myself just now. "
"1245","Warriors","Better"
"1246","Warriors","Lol. This guy..."
"1247","Warriors","He had a great game 2 I thought, on the offensive end. But defensively he has been bad."
"1248","Warriors","Hawks are getting totally chumped by pump fakes"
"1249","Warriors","Hawks with another leap by instead of a close out "
"1250","Warriors","game, blouses"
"1251","Warriors","Wack transition offense by the Hawks "
"1252","Warriors","MICHAEL JORDAN WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN HURT."
"1253","Warriors","Seriously Reggie... You're giving us ammo."
"1254","Warriors","Why are the Hawks settling for outside shots?  They can get better shots in the paint.  Clearly they've been able to get a few stops against the Cavs, so why not go for 2 and then stop on the other end?"
"1255","Warriors","Is it just me or did the Hawks' offensive system just change from what it was in the regular season to now?"
"1256","Warriors","Dat slow motion ankle stretching. American sports television at its finest. Almost better than our awesome sports graphics."
"1257","Warriors","man this cavs PA guy is shit"
"1258","Warriors","Why?"
"1259","Warriors","Great point"
"1260","Warriors","Teague's ball handling and quickness is an underrated part of his game "
"1261","Warriors","Lil B blew a kiss and that Teague FT went in."
"1262","Warriors","Teague is pretty inconsistent at finishing. Dude needs to get better at it and he'd be a huge danger "
"1263","Warriors","Good point.  This is as far as a lot of these guys have gotten."
"1264","Warriors","Why do you know what that looks like?"
"1265","Warriors","Teague was watching the Warriors/Rockets game yesterday and now thinks he's Steph Curry"
"1266","Warriors","the fuck. another 3 pointer?"
"1267","Warriors","Cavs have to expend 0 energy on defense.  Hawks don't even try to get some movement going"
"1268","Warriors","Exactly.  Hawks have been rebounding pretty well against them even with TT on the floor.  Imagine how much easier it's gonna be when he's gone."
"1269","Warriors","Great job Teague, you finally made one!"
"1270","Warriors","Steph Teague?"
"1271","Warriors","TEAGUE STOP SHOOTNG THREES"
"1272","Warriors","clutch

goat

amazing"
"1273","Warriors","Another fly by instead of closing out. Same corner. Three times. Lol"
"1274","Warriors","LeBron likes people to have hope before he crushes them."
"1275","Warriors","I've never seen so many fly by 3 pointers.  "
"1276","Warriors","do the hawks always jump when someone pump fakes from 3?"
"1277","Warriors","the bottom left corner should be forever called ""Curry's Corner"""
"1278","Warriors","Damn LeBron Killin it on the boards. "
"1279","Warriors","35/18/12 is still fucking insane "
"1280","Warriors","Why didn't he fucking grab that ball??"
"1281","Warriors","ILL JUST LET THIS BALL GO OUT OF BOUNDS EVEN THOUGH ITS OFF ON US

"
"1282","Warriors","Did LeBron even touch that? Lol"
"1283","Warriors","LeBron used the force to block that ball. Cheating"
"1284","Warriors","Teague is terrible at finishing and Scott is an idiot for not grabbing that rebound. I can't even..."
"1285","Warriors","I think Teague just simply missed. "
"1286","Warriors","That foul by lebron.. is a no call LOL"
"1287","Warriors","idk how Teague missed that. he had a step and looked like he got caught deciding between trying to dunk or glancing it off the backboard."
"1288","Warriors","I really don't want this series to end in a sweep. I NEED MORE BASKETBALL."
"1289","Warriors","WOW how do the refs call this? 

It's a fucking tie"
"1290","Warriors","Need no 3 pointer defense"
"1291","Warriors","He's been bad tonight at the rim"
"1292","Warriors","Hawks fucked up."
"1293","Warriors","Double OT please. I love this"
"1294","Warriors","That was way too easy for LeBron"
"1295","Warriors","3/16 shooting by Harden in game 3..."
"1296","Warriors","Look at Delly's legs, that's what convinced me that it was malicious/dirty. His legs are driving him towards Al, not just letting him fall in a position that would be easy to get up from.
BONUS: compare it to the Korver injury.
Edit: Downvotes and other discussions have swayed me the other way. It just looked so much like a typical go for the knees tackle at first! Guess I'm just as reactionary as the next r/NBA hoops fan!"
"1297","Warriors","If hawks lose, everyone's going to point to the last play call in regulation."
"1298","Warriors","You're only starting to lose respect now? Reggie is straight up awful. No pun intended. "
"1299","Warriors","Hawks need an actual all-star."
"1300","Warriors","well, not everybody.  the other team in that arena didn't quit. 
"
"1301","Warriors","I've seen how Big Dick Dray kicked his ass every game this past week ;)"
"1302","Warriors","Holy shit Lebron's stats look like your stats when you play 2k15. "
"1303","Warriors","Dray, he's a great player. Most likely first ballot Hall of Fame."
"1304","Warriors","Yes"
"1305","Warriors","Yes"
"1306","Warriors","No, I'm already starting the celebrations"
"1307","Warriors","Mike Scott had an all-time bad game down the stretch"
"1308","Warriors","at this point in my life, i just watch nba games on mute..."
"1309","Warriors","Lebron doing the James Harden but doing it on the other side of the fence lol"
"1310","Warriors","when were you"
"1311","Warriors","LeBron is a good actor"
"1312","Warriors","This is what happens when you play for OT on the road."
"1313","Warriors","LeBron in the same position as Harden after game 2. Except one was succesful. "
"1314","Warriors","Great hustle by both teams all the way till the end."
"1315","Warriors","If hawks lose, everyone's going to point to the last play call in regulation time."
"1316","Warriors","Hawks had so many chances to win this. I still can't get over how awful professional basketball players can be at closing out on a shooter. The fly bys were insane this game. The Hawks did that repeatedly. You learn how to do that as a kid. How do you get to this level without being disciplined? "
"1317","Warriors","LeBron's statline was so Westbrook"
"1318","Warriors","This is what happens when you play for OT on the road."
"1319","Warriors","career high FG attempts help"
"1320","Warriors","Missed his first 10 too. Most people would stop shooting. 

"
"1321","Warriors","FUCK.  I really wanted the Hawks to tie that. "
"1322","Warriors","Well that was an interesting game."
"1323","Warriors","He's good."
"1324","Warriors","LBJ so hype at the end there he converted to Islam"
"1325","Warriors","holy shit lebron"
"1326","Warriors","real winner is everyone angling to change how the playoffs are seeded"
"1327","Warriors","lol Lebron imitating Harden"
"1328","Warriors","Why didn't the ball go to Teague?"
"1329","Warriors","so thirsty for the post-game ~~karma~~ glory you mistyped hawks"
"1330","Warriors","We are lucky to be experiencing the Lebron era live

37/18/13

Those are stats you see when you play as yourself in 2k15"
"1331","Warriors","That game was better than I expected, no pun intended."
"1332","Warriors","Insane game to watch!!!"
"1333","Warriors","IF Coach Kerr asked Draymond to play a Harden role, Dray would be averaging 30/10/10 ala Big O style"
"1334","Warriors","http://i.imgur.com/CkA1qzi.gifv"
"1335","Warriors","Since 4 minutes to go in teh 4th quarter, have the Hawks only hit 1 field goal?"
"1336","Warriors","LeBron is ready for a bomb ass nap"
"1337","Warriors","Wow, the Hawks had all the chances in the world. Tie game with 17 seconds to go, iso 3 pointer by Teague with LeBron bearing down on him. Mike Scott with a chance to secure the rebound and just watched it go to the Cavs. Wide open 3 pointer to tie the game in OT. All missed."
"1338","Warriors","I'm not a raging LeBron hater, but his Paul Pierce injury antics are unbecoming for someone as good as he is."
"1339","Warriors","Shady as hell dude.  You can see him gather his feet, set and then push off into Horfords knees.  It's not clean by any stretch of the imagination. "
"1340","Warriors","Lebron James just impregnated the entire city of Cleveland with that 37 points, 18 rebounds 13 assists performance. "
"1341","Warriors","Lmao"
"1342","Warriors","Hey man, just because LeBron's bones are adamantium and he can't feel physical pain doesn't mean he's not out there every day putting on for his city"
"1343","Warriors","I know that the cavs deserve their respects  for dominating,  but the hawks need to be  proud. While missing  2 of their 4 most important players and getting  destroyed  on the boards, they were able to  keep it close away. Sure the cavs were  also down 2 of their big 3, but after getting  their asses kicked  at home, the hawks stepped it up.

Edit : i cant spell"
"1344","Warriors","Flops don't lie, dude"
"1345","Warriors","Did he call bank?!"
"1346","Warriors","The ankle really didn't seem like much"
"1347","Warriors","Dont even try to defend this crap, come on nba"
"1348","Warriors","The agony of being Shelden Mack."
"1349","Warriors","""First players with such numbers"" lol. Talk about  lazy."
"1350","Warriors","Lebron, ""I'm hurting but I'm a hero and I have a huge dick. Team effort!"" Haha this dude was so beastly tonight. Damn!"
"1351","Warriors","**THEY PICKED THIS DUDE AS COY OVER STEVER KERR LMFAO**"
"1352","Warriors","Bron is still the man"
"1353","Warriors","LeBron looked so happy saying he'll be playing to Rachel :')"
"1354","Warriors","OUTBACK JESUS"
"1355","Warriors","I'm confused, aren't we all just warrior fans here?"
"1356","Warriors","Yeah.  Not the kind of efficiency that matches MJ. "
"1357","Warriors","Incredible effort from the Hawks "
"1358","Warriors","do you happen to have a link?  I would just like to see that (and btw, good on him then.  too many people won't admit when they are wrong.  It's more rare than it should be). "
"1359","Warriors","quit hating"
"1360","Warriors","haha, well meme'd my friend!"
"1361","Warriors","Dellavedova 2016 MVP confirmed. "
"1362","Warriors","They suck"
"1363","Warriors","What a savage. "
"1364","Warriors","LeBron James is a god damn legend. I don't give a fuck what anyone says. He is a fucking LEGEND."
"1365","Warriors","the hate has been out of hand for years"
"1366","Warriors","? I don't hate LeBron. I actually like him, but I wouldn't say I'm a ""fan"" of his. I'm a Warriors fan because I grew up there.

I would have posted this even were I a Cavs fan, would that still make you root for LeBron?"
"1367","Warriors","Mo DGAF. "
"1368","Warriors","Ok, tell me that when the clips go past the 2nd round"
"1369","Warriors","Lerbon is my favorite basketball team"
"1370","Warriors","Yea.. i'm sure it was some crazy mind-fucking defense he played there."
"1371","Warriors","I realize that, but Rudy Gay didn't have Wade and Chris Bosh on his team and LeBron still took a shot at him."
"1372","Warriors","they went for a ""don't turn the ball over and jack up a terrible shot"""
"1373","Warriors","no"
"1374","Warriors","Did he apologize to Lil B?"
"1375","Warriors","not after losing in 5 in the finals again."
"1376","Warriors","What a dumb comment. Efficiency is an important part of winning, don't act like they're completely separate."
"1377","Warriors","Yeah, but I don't think you will be liking Steph in the finals.  "
"1378","Warriors","bruh, he already lead the warriors to the first seed and now the finals...what else is there to talk about? Facts are that James Harden is a god awful player and a detriment to the game with his free throw/ref dependent style."
"1379","Warriors","His long range success forced the tightness and a great fake was all it took. Great execution."
"1380","Warriors","Pete Maravich with a three point line in today's pace and space era would be insane. Curry always gets compared to Nash but there's another good comparison for you."
"1381","Warriors","im glad a laker fan acknowledged it"
"1382","Warriors","get the fuck outta here."
"1383","Warriors","RAIDERS"
"1384","Warriors","My boy, Rabsho, HB40 tearin it up!"
"1385","Warriors","Because that's jot how we judge GMs. The job that y do isn't always immediately apparent. If you are averaging 5 PPG now and  averaged 30 ppg 2 seasons ago that has no bearing on the current season. Players =/= GMs. "
"1386","Warriors","I mean they did force OT without Korver, AND Horford. That'd be like us missing Draymond and Klay or something"
"1387","Warriors","Yeah, Dray&gt;Harden...what other proof do we need?"
"1388","Warriors","people wont appreciate lebron probably until he's done, and even then I'm not entirely sure, its rediculous"
"1389","Warriors","This playoffs is full of close games which don't show in all theses lopsided series "
"1390","Warriors","
Browns?"
"1391","Warriors","Dellavedova definitely kept moving toward horford and went at his legs. He was trying to instigate/embellish contact and make it look like Horford was fouling him. IF it was another player, I can understand giving Horford a flagrant 2, but after all of Dellavedova's bullshit this playoffs, the refs should have known better. "
"1392","Warriors","Yeah an injury will occur one day and that'll change everything. "
"1393","Warriors","With Bazemore pull up threes.. just because dudes made tough shots does not change the fact that he was running teague isolations"
"1394","Warriors","Hands full with the Rockets? We're beating their asses almost as much as Mo and Warriors rocked that AD bootay. Sweeping them just like we swept you fools aside. "
"1395","Warriors","He probably thinks Doris Burke is a milf too"
"1396","Warriors","It is, because people are far likelier to remember you failing on a larger stage, and legacies are about perception. "
"1397","Warriors","/r/nba hates every team and every player, if not all the time, then at some point. 

don't worry about it. "
"1398","Warriors","Blocks so many "
"1399","Warriors","He walks to his bed, lies down and closes his eyes"
"1400","Warriors","Cya at the game thread tomorrow, Warriors bro!"
"1401","Warriors","The rockets don't have lebron"
"1402","Warriors","Imagine if Lebron wasn't playing. "
"1403","Warriors","Players holding each others arms is a common enough occurence in every game.  Refs call that foul when they see it.  But to use that as an excuse to roll over someone's legs is dirty.  

"
"1404","Warriors","You almost as stupid as AD's teeth is fucked up. Nobody has ever come back down from 3-0, we just dominated them at their own house by 35. 3-1 and 3-0 are completely different. "
"1405","Warriors","Uh, you realize Westbrook turns the ball over a ton as well, right? And yes, actually ORTG is entirely influenced by team stats. Usage has nothing to do with efficiency, so no, you are saying Bogut is as efficient as Westbrook on less usage. If you want another example, you are saying Klay is as ""efficient"" as Lebron and more than Westbrook. Ok, if you say so..."
"1406","Warriors","He has a pretty good chance, but ring or not, he needs no justification of his greatness at this point. We can talk about it as it's happening. "
"1407","Warriors","Almost every call where they had to use slow-mo was ridiculous. 

""Hmm, I don't know. This one is really close. I think I have to watch it in slo-mo a few more times.""

No you don't. The Hawks just slapped the ball away. It's Cavs ball. My 4 year old is calling it too."
"1408","Warriors","R/NBA is consistent a lot of the time people aren't efficient have other options or they lose games and thus the criticism. "
"1409","Warriors","I'm pretty sure Hawks fans appreciate how good Teague is"
"1410","Warriors","Curry

Klay

BD Dray

Harrison Barnes

Bogut"
"1411","Warriors","I remember when the Lakers tried to instill the motion Princeton offense everyone shit on it saying it was only to be used by unathletic guys, not world class nba teams. Funny how things turn out."
"1412","Warriors","I agree.  "
"1413","Warriors","Andrew Luck turned around the Colts."
"1414","Warriors","he was hitting big shots left and right and wrecking harden off the dribble"
"1415","Warriors","I agree he's the best of his generation but ehh didn't feel like the flu game to me at all. felt a lot more like watching kobe put it completely on himself to win, hobbling off then coming back, and a lot of FGA while ultimately getting it done"
"1416","Warriors","1 bad game with half your starters injured or ejected doesn't invalidate a whole year of coaching a team waaaaay beyond expectations. 

And also those Teague isolations were working. So I'm not sure what the issue was."
"1417","Warriors","Those are not good numbers. "
"1418","Warriors","Well, ky and kevin are both huge players for the cavs, but the fact  of the matter is that LeBron  without  those  2 was able to dominate  a hawks team with al horford and kyle korver. Now with  those 2 out, the hawks managed to bounce  back  and nearly win a game where they have up inordinate numbers  of offensive  rebounds. Sure it sucks to lose, but it's  better to lose knowing you battled"

"1422","Warriors","Dellavedova

The NBA reincarnation of Bruce Bowen/Derek Fisher. "
"1423","Warriors","hope both teams sweep, want to see both teams healthy in the finals"
"1424","Warriors","Horford retaliated with an elbow after Delly dove into his knees.  Horford earned his ejection but Delly is a dirty mofo for taking out legs."
"1425","Warriors","This post has literally nothing to do with my being a GS fan. I would have posted this even if I was a Cavaliers fan. Since the day he said this, I was waiting for the day for he actually took 37 shots in a game - not because I dislike LeBron (quite the opposite) but because I didn't like how he took a unnecessary shot at Rudy Gay like that."
"1426","Warriors","Can't wait for a good ole Aussie brawl between Deladova and Bogut"
"1427","Warriors","Rockets and Memphis fans said much the same stuff."
"1428","Warriors","If you're not salty when your teams loses in the conference finals why the fuck are you watching sports?"

"1430","Warriors","delavedova is a dirty hairy rat"
"1431","Warriors","Still butthurt Steph fucked AD dumb? "

"1437","Warriors","Drama queen? Am I the only one that sees he has a flair for dramatizing? He damn near cried like a baby on the floor of the court. Dude likes upping the drama while beasting entire teams "
"1438","Warriors","Take off the rose colored glasses, my man"
"1439","Warriors","At least 3 of the 6 games were exciting all of the way through, right guys? ...guys? Hello?... Ah well, hope you'll be back for the Finals."
"1440","Warriors","Wow I had no idea how idea how easy it was to make clips with that site, too easy one might say...

"1441","Warriors","You must be blind. "
"1442","Warriors","So with this logic. I've Never seen you fight so you must be the biggest fuccboi in existence. "
"1443","Warriors","Atlanta should have closed this when Lebron was still Complaining and never got back in D. 5v4 and atl still couldn't get a bucket."
"1444","Warriors","Yeah idk what he was thinking not grabbing that. How could he have possibly thought that it would definitively be hawks ball? He just let it dribble right by him, I couldn't believe that shit"
"1445","Warriors","I don't think you know what the word ""threaten"" means"
"1446","Warriors","You mean Gentry. Kerr is a great coach but Gentry is an offensive mastermind. "
"1447","Warriors","Also the first to get 37 / 18 / 13"
"1448","Warriors","I don't even recognize this hawks offense anymore.  Comparing to when they beat the warriors in the regular season, the current Hawks has no ball movement or player movement.  Every play looks like iso ball.  Most importantly, getting dominated inside by TT just blew my mind.  

where is the Spur-sian basketball i was promised!!?"
"1449","Warriors","Horford let the team down"
"1450","Warriors","we do, again sometimes.  there's been times when I am astounded by the level of hate for the W's on here. 

And then it shifts to someone else, like the Rockets. Or the Clippers.  Or Lebron.  Probably the W's again at some point soon..... "
"1451","Warriors","k, thanks. "
"1452","Warriors","please. stop."
"1453","Warriors","I'm not saying that's what he did, but the infamous Paul Pierce wheel chair incident -- Yea, players do some dumb shit to create a better story. It adds drama. It gets the home crowd involved. It's fun for the fans. "
"1454","Warriors","Me either"
"1455","Warriors","Has anyone ever gotten 37 / 17 / 13?"
"1456","Warriors","&gt;this game 7


Next season  hasn't  even started yet, and you're  already  talking  about  its postseason? "

"1459","Warriors","You are telling me, you are aboslutely mystified why other people have a different opinion? Okay..."
"1460","Warriors","that attempt to show emotion and rally the crowd when they cut the lead to 19 was sad in retrospect."
"1461","Warriors","We could play doctor right now"
"1462","Warriors","If adamk5 posts the same statement as we've seen 
multiple times before, will I murder them? "
"1463","Warriors","Unfortunately injuries have hurt them big time. "
"1464","Warriors","Please somebody keep Skip away from the Warriors bandwagon."
"1465","Warriors","I mean, the first 2 games were really  close."

"1469","Warriors","Al. I forgot about thabo though. "
"1470","Warriors","This sub is mostly cringrworthy trash since all the casual fans come out of the woodworks come pkayoff time  whom know little about the ins and outs of the game. "
"1471","Warriors","He'd fuck his knees up...that's for damn sure."
"1472","Warriors","If he does that in Oakland, literally no one on the Cavs will make it out of the city alive. "
"1473","Warriors","On which Western team?"
"1474","Warriors","3 frames? Break down the entire play frame by frame instead of cherry picking 3."
"1475","Warriors","Someone photoshop him next to Harden in a mosque please"
"1476","Warriors","What if he were a Spur?"
"1477","Warriors","LeBron is playing the media like a fiddle"
"1478","Warriors","Harden's will too, but for entirely different reasons.

[He sad here](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xPHX0TnrneTZ5KPrutfJ70oTsyc=/109x0:1142x689/730x487/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46376144/hdn.0.0.jpg)"
"1479","Warriors","Kobe acts like it ain't no thing. LeBron is never gonna be as cool as Kobe."
"1480","Warriors","lmao James Harden had 38-10-9 on better efficiency fuck off troll"
"1481","Warriors","Just because he is one of the best players does not mean that he would not lose to the spurs in the first or second round instead of the finals.  Maybe he loses to the warriors in the second round this year or something.  There is no way to be able to tell."
"1482","Warriors","Not with all the injuries  the cavs have. If we manage to still make the finals next year (which  I Doubt) and the cavs return  healthy, then that would be a  hell of a  series. But as it is now, i think  the Warriors  can pretty handily beat the cavs."
"1483","Warriors","My memory is all about Hedo being unstoppable and Lewis shooting out of his mind that year."
"1484","Warriors","Is Mike Miller bring Dwayne Wade with him?  So I ask once again do the Cleveland Cavaliers have a championship?"
"1485","Warriors","[ALLAH](http://i.imgur.com/5mSas2f.jpg)"

"1489","Warriors","I actively ignore Bayless...time to go back to that philosophy."
"1490","Warriors","Nah, just the new ones. "
"1491","Warriors","You know what, I don't think he did."
"1492","Warriors","Oh no the playoff cramps have returned! lol."
"1493","Warriors","He wouldn't leave the arena alive. "
"1494","Warriors","It will happen eventually for sure, but it's also more likely to happen in low-scoring sports where the variance is higher. So I don't think it'll happen for a long time, unless a crucial injury happens or something else big."
"1495","Warriors","Well obviously but there is no way we can know if he would of gone to 5 straight finals if he was in the west all these years.  It definitely would of been more difficult."
"1496","Warriors","only if people really want it to be...Hawks lost the series going down 0-2 at home and losing korver. it was great that Lebron willed this win--but ""iconic"" is a bit much"
"1497","Warriors","How dare you disrespect Mo Speights like that"
"1498","Warriors","With purple trim...."
"1499","Warriors","GOATs don't get manhandled in their primes. How would it look if he got swept in the finals."
"1500","Warriors","I think he did that because he tripped, and his arm was being pulled by Horford."
"1501","Warriors","A few years, actually. He really likes Curry. "
"1502","Warriors","got shut down, Lebron's in for a tough break next series."
"1503","Warriors","What dude? So you're saying the cops just made up some bullshit to cover up their blatantly sadistic and probably racist abuse of power. Likely fuckin story"
"1504","Warriors","Dynasties fall Lord Riley, and he no longer has dragons."
"1505","Warriors","Beautiful"
"1506","Warriors","Reggie tends to repeat himself over and over and over again. "
"1507","Warriors","Yes. "
"1508","Warriors","You can clearly see Delly pushing off with both feet into Horford.  Horford earned his ejection and Delly is a dirty player.  "
"1509","Warriors","&gt;Still bet he would be well short of 30 though.

I'm not so sure, Lebron has had a TON of 1 assist/1 rebound short of a triple double games. There was a post sometime this year where someone counted the amount of games like that in his career and it was an obscene number. I could easily see him having 18+ in the playoffs. Hell he just had one last game didnt he?"
"1510","Warriors","You can only lose once and you're out, though. Very impressive stat nonetheless."
"1511","Warriors","Yeah, except the NBA has a proud tradition of hustle players doing shit like that to try and get people injured who are masters at looking innocent. Bruce Bowen, Robert Horry, Paul Pierce, Z-Bo, any guard on the Detroit Pistons since 1988, and so on - they were all masters at making their slips and tumbles riskier for opposing players... especially come playoff time.

Bruce Bowen was actually a master at this, bringing the ""I accidentally slid a bit and my foot was just happened to end up under where he was trying to land"" thing to an art form. It's nearly impossible to say if it was or wasn't an accident, which is why these moves are so popular. Every player in the NBA (even the worst bench player) is amazing, and buying the ""accidental slip that happens to be risky for opposing players"" thing is a bit much... especially when it seems that more players use tricks like that in the playoffs than don't (even the ""clean"" Nash Suns had Raja Bell doing shit like that).

So when you say ""it's possible"", yeah it is. But I don't buy it for a second. These guys are just too damn good for accidents like that to happen, otherwise people would end up injured in practice a helluvalot more often."
"1512","Warriors","#BABY WON'T YOU COME MY WA^AAA^^YYYY"
"1513","Warriors","Horford clearly calling Delly a dirty player."
"1514","Warriors","#STRAAAWWWBEEERRRR^YYYY"
"1515","Warriors","How was 6'4 Jason Kidd such a great rebounder, despite not even being [comparatively] that athletic?"
"1516","Warriors","but have you considered ""?"""
"1517","Warriors","I feel bad for Shelvin Mack... even though the Hawks are probably getting swept (and likely would have lost even this game in OT) he's not going to forget that soon."
"1518","Warriors","Possibly the finals."
"1519","Warriors","[*LAHW*ry](https://youtu.be/Cu2gVjiE6Uw)"
"1520","Warriors","&lt; 1 second inbound scores are often the result of bad defense, it was still a good play though."
"1521","Warriors","Shoulda tagged him"
"1522","Warriors","More like 25-1 for all playoff series."
"1523","Warriors","Magic actually had 12 ""LeBron triple doubles"" with only 9 A/R. LeBron has had 9.

"
"1524","Warriors","Wow. I know this is mainly sarcastic but its weird. I don't know Curry but everything Ive heard about the guy is truly incredible. My best friend has even met him twice and has a long time friend who is close with Curry. And the stories I hear about Steph sometimes even make me feel guilty for how genuine and compassionate he is. The guys a quiet, well mannered, mature man and a great husband/father/teamate. He would be the most giving guy you know.  

Its weird now that he's a superstar, because fans from other teams literally feel hatred towards the guy. And all he does is throw a ball into a circle. People on here need to remember that and reserve their hatred for actual bad people.   
  
I don't like the Clippers, I don't like when Jamal Crawford goes off against us. But everything I've heard about the guy is he's awesome and has a huge heart. But yeah, Fuck that, I fucking hate him because he's on that other team, and they scored more than my FAVORITE team!"
"1525","Warriors","I don't think the Gibson thing was ""dirty,"" it was irritating and just not a basketball play. Like Lance blowing in LeBron's ear.

Dirty is like Dahntay Jones, or throwing elbows. The kinda shit that is meant to cause injury, or even end your playing career.

I think there's another category of ""reckless."" It's one of the reasons a lot of people dislike Tyler Hansbrough. When you play overly physical to the point of taking players out, when you don't have the situational awareness to protect the health of the people around you- that's being reckless.

I think the Korver incident was reckless. You're taught to shield the ball with your body when you recover a loose ball- and a lot of us who played Jr High ball did those drills (well... at least we did). But you're not taught to throw your body *over* the ball. You grab, pull, and tuck.

I think what Delly did in that Korver incident is probably not dirty, but it was reckless. Sometimes in the playoffs, you play reckless. But he should learn from that and play with more caution- and if he doesn't, then he shouldn't be on a basketball court."
"1526","Warriors","Where is the arbitrary police now?? Why do they only come out when it's not Lebron?"
"1527","Warriors","/r/shittyhdr"
"1528","Warriors","Yeah, it was pretty clear from the replay. That was 100% Al."
"1529","Warriors","Same reason Malone+Payton Lakers didn't win it all either."
"1530","Warriors","we'd make the playoffs, that's my guess"
"1531","Warriors","""I generally believe the team that scores the most points will indeed win the match"""
"1532","Warriors","The year before they had Clyde instead of Pippen too."
"1533","Warriors","He probably meant that he didn't know a player could get any worse at defense"
"1534","Warriors","Allen jumps high on his shot, but so do Gerald Henderson and sometimes Kobe and Gerald Green."
"1535","Warriors","Le Master Bron"
"1536","Warriors","Also Marc Gasol, he usually has no ""dip"""
"1537","Warriors","its just basketball. lol"
"1538","Warriors","He was well beyond the point of no return as far as falling over goes (IMO at least)
"
"1539","Warriors","This needs to be shopped"
"1540","Warriors","Cmon man LeBron has wrecked us consistently, don't ever count a team with him on it out."
"1541","Warriors","Yep."
"1542","Warriors","Not really. LeBron's regular season MVP case wasn't widely considered to be as strong as Curry's."
"1543","Warriors","Horford deserved the ejection, but after what I've seen from Dellavedova, the fact that he has not been ejected from a game yet in the playoffs is inexcusable. Only people who don't play basketball couldn't see what he was doing on that play. He does the same kind of shit that Derek Fisher and Bruce Bowen did for years, and he does it in the same way so he ends up not being caught/punished for it.  "
"1544","Warriors","A bit surprised Kobe isn't higher."
"1545","Warriors","And Cavs can do the same -- should be a fun finals. "
"1546","Warriors","&gt; cancerous

..."
"1547","Warriors","so you're saying that Dwight should have been a model instead of a basketball player"
"1548","Warriors","I should move to LA. "
"1549","Warriors","A random collection of words, strung together to try and sound technical"
"1550","Warriors","That is not really a normal thing for their franchise."
"1551","Warriors","Almost  2008 LeBron. 

The fact that 2008 LeBron could dunk on Duncan and Garnett at the tail end of their primes was insane. TBH, his dunks back then were on a different plane.

This LeBron can do that to players like Muscala, but subjectively he's lost some of his youthful athleticism. 

He's made up for it with skill and leadership though. "
"1552","Warriors","It's asinine to think that two teams this good (Warriors and Cavs) aren't going to have issues with each other. Butters not equate the Hawks with the Warriors."
"1553","Warriors","Lol what a condescending remark. This is basically, ""good job Hawksbros, you'll get them next year!"""
"1554","Warriors","Both"
"1555","Warriors","He was way more open than he thought he would be and probably thought he had less time than he actually did and he freaked out and rushed the shot"
"1556","Warriors","I feel like in /r/nba you're not allowed to say good things about your own team. If someone with different flair says ""oh my god lebron is GOAT"" they get all kinds of karma, but cavs fans have to be all ""pretty good, even though he took a lot of shots"""
"1557","Warriors","A tip in still counts as a field goal and thus a field goal attempted. It's not deceiving that they are included"
"1558","Warriors","Sharks vs Kings... Two years ago"
"1559","Warriors","Isn't this game also available for Android devices through the Play Store? It seems a little odd that they would only make it free for iOS devices"
"1560","Warriors","God damn, that Barkley line though: 43-15-10-2-2 on 22 shots and 11-11 free throws. As somebody who was too young when Barkley was playing to really see him, I really only see him as an annoying commentator who says stupid shit about my team, but stats like that really show that he could play with the best of them in his prime"
"1561","Warriors","Terrible decision making.  I'm routing for the Hawks, but man they make it hard..."
"1562","Warriors","No idea what he could be thinking there. "
"1563","Warriors","I just want to see Curry make it rain."
"1564","Warriors","Don't get caught up in the ""narrative"". Cleveland has sported solid teams in different eras, has made the Finals once, has had the highest win total in the league at least twice, and is strongly associated with one of the absolute greatest players of all time, who won two MVPs with the franchise. They haven't won the grand prize, but hardly the most ""unsuccessful"" of all franchises (at least compared to other candidate franchises)."
"1565","Warriors","way to copy my username..."
"1566","Warriors","I think the Dubs will have trouble containing Lebron and the Cavs will have a hard time covering Curry. So naturally I'm ready to watch them both go off "
"1567","Warriors","Ya that was the moment I was thinking of, really a beautiful display for a fan base to do that and show their love for their team even when they couldn't quite get it done. That's what real fans look like."
"1568","Warriors","What I'm saying is he doesn't have a shooting threat this year and the Warriors won't need to double him and have a great run protector willing to meet him at the rim.

With this we can stop him from creating these open threes for everyone."
"1569","Warriors","Delly's becoming an Aussie icon, going in hard is the Australian way. Him and Bogut doing us all proud.  "
"1570","Warriors","Lol I don't know what the guy expected."
"1571","Warriors","Correct. That would be a terrible bet to take too but I guess if it wins it wins. Way too big of risk for a small payout. Betting large money lines long term is a losing strategy. "
"1572","Warriors","Lmao not much to be salty about right now as a warrior fan, fam"
"1573","Warriors","Try to play big against the Warriors small ball?"
"1574","Warriors","Nothing a little Viagra can't fix."
"1575","Warriors","Point taken, but I really meant that Kidd's vertical isn't great, even though having a high vertical is helpful in rebounding, which makes his rebounding numbers even more surprising."
"1576","Warriors","Are most Alaskans Seattle fans still?"
"1577","Warriors","It would be really interesting to hear from other NBA players especially veterans on their thoughts about this incident."
"1578","Warriors","Like a lot of poor free throwers he has gotten worse every year or are very up and down.

"1580","Warriors","TT at the 5 isn't big..."
"1581","Warriors","People were hella excited. I remember he called Rip Hamilton a mini Steve Kerr lol. He was still better than 90% of the NBA. 

I was more excited when Magic Johnson came back in the 90s to be honest. He was a shell of his former self, but I'll never forget how he faked Sprewell out of his shoes and went in for a layup. His hands were still SO QUICK. "
"1582","Warriors","Love would probably do a little more shot creating than average if he was in Kyrie was out though"
"1583","Warriors","When was best of 7 introduced?"
"1584","Warriors","Lol it's like the Harden one but this is relief instead"
"1585","Warriors","I hope kyrie is 100%. If we're gonna have a Warriors - Cavaliers finals it better be a damn good series. "
"1586","Warriors","Delly looking like Charlie Kelly"
"1587","Warriors","God fucking damnit"
"1588","Warriors","This, everyone needs to look at this. Delly is being dragged down by al Horford "
"1589","Warriors","bron handle tough postgame questions better than anyone"
"1590","Warriors","Davis Playoffs Per36: 26.4 ppg, 9.2 rpg, 1.7 apg, 2.5 bpg

Blake Playoffs Per36: 23.1 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 5.6 apg, 0.9 bpg"
"1591","Warriors","He's already better than Clint Capela and Joey Dorsey"
"1592","Warriors","Oh he was definitely not humble afterwards at all lol. "
"1593","Warriors","Dellavedova basically dove at his knees.... wouldn't have minded seeing Horford blast him with a knee/elbow after that dirty shit."
"1594","Warriors","He's not very good, no pun intended. "
"1595","Warriors","The Clippers give up fewer points per possession when he's off the court.

Not saying he's a bad defender, but he's certainly not the top DPOY candidate people say he is."
"1596","Warriors","That's bullshit.  Dellavedova clearly went low after Horford's knee on that play.  That's bush league dirty play.  How can you possibly have the cognitive disconnect to not see that shit?"
"1597","Warriors","Is this still the case post-ACL injury, though?"
"1598","Warriors","eh, so like, im not saying you ""can't"", shouldn't maybe, but if you do you better make sure you knock him out of the game too

 not that this was necessarily the case here, but if you felt a guy was trying to injure you/your teammates, you make sure you bring the pain, go for the artest elbow, what's the point in retaliating if it only affects your team, like did horford really think that weak ass strike was gonna send a message?"
"1599","Warriors","Comment is deleted. What'd it say?"
"1600","Warriors","Totally with you guys.  Someone pulls that shit on me or a friend in a pickup game and they're getting blasted or run off the court with a warning to never come back.  

That was a bush-league cheap shot that can end careers.  I doubt he thought it through, but that roll-for-the-knees shit is one of the lowest plays you can make in sports, right along with undercutting players going to the rim or diving/chop-blocking the knee on an engaged lineman.

Dellavedova should be suspended for the rest of the playoffs."
"1601","Warriors","Chalmers is in the ""top half of the top 10"" /s"
"1602","Warriors","He's shooting 15% in the playoffs taking ridiculous amount of 3s"
"1603","Warriors","We don't need the leadership but literally everything else...we'll take that. "
"1604","Warriors","Are you really so stupidly blinded by team loyalty that you can look at that and not think Dellavedova tried to roll Horford's knee?  

That's a dirty fucking play, get real.  Trying to defend it just makes Cavs fans look as bush-league as ""Delly"" is."
"1605","Warriors","Well, we did significantly improve after those 2 losses to the grizz, so there's that "
"1606","Warriors","If he's involved in another incident by the end of the playoffs I don't care what anyone says. 4 times isn't an accident. 


I'll be watching him during the finals. Like a hawk. "
"1607","Warriors","http://i.imgur.com/y6ZjK04.gif"
"1608","Warriors","It is definitely a brotherhood between the players that make it. I played with a few guys in college that made it to NFL and they all said the samething. Al was wrong to elbow him and there isn't an excuse for that. "
"1609","Warriors","Deserved the ejection, although Delly was no innocent victim.

If Lebron did what Horford did would he be ejected? Highly doubtful."
"1610","Warriors","What did you call him out for? Lying? Creating non-existent drama? Being a complete jackass? "
"1611","Warriors","GOAT Boobie Gibson or GOAT Mario Chalmer or GOAT Norris Cole? Which guard was worse.."
"1612","Warriors","What if you beat a team 8 times in a row?"
"1613","Warriors","I didn't even know who he was before this season "
"1614","Warriors","I'd probably get super ripped too if I decided to deadlift that cash and not just sleep on it"
"1615","Warriors","I thought Anthony Randolph had some talent though, he was just a head case."
"1616","Warriors","I feel like the comments in this thread are people pretending as if LeBron isn't in pain and is just playing the media. He's hurt, he's still able to play. Don't blame LeBron for the media potentially exaggerating the injury"
"1617","Warriors","[MFW](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpj1d4zH5Y1r0byljo1_500.gif) watching this develop"
"1618","Warriors","How many times is this gonna get asked. 


With that said, kevin love was a huge blow, especially matchup wise. Too many injuries to the cavs this year to realistically think they can win 4 games first against this year's warriors squad. Dubs in 5/6"
"1619","Warriors","Dubs in 5."
"1620","Warriors","And? "
"1621","Warriors","Warriors in 5.  I think the only way the Cavs even win one game is if LeBron plays a super efficient, clean (little turnovers) game, and then I could see it going to five or six. I just don't think a depleted Cavs roster can take the Warriors, barring any major injury. I see this as last year repeating, except LeBron has even less help than he had back then. Of course, this could be the homerism talking. "
"1622","Warriors","I like how you point out sweeping without Irving but ignore the Hawks injuries."
"1623","Warriors","Grabbing a dude with his feet is dirty. Also flopping every play like a little bitch may not be dirty, but it's a bitch way to play"
"1624","Warriors","Al was definitely in the wrong here but Dellavedov plays dirty as hell.

Dellavedov has tried attacking the legs of shooters he's guarding 3 times now from what i've seen."
"1625","Warriors","Rockets in 5/6"
"1626","Warriors","It's not closer to his average against GS tho. He averaged 25/5/5 on 40/24/78 at -17 w/ a .513 TS. 

"
"1627","Warriors","This is a great comparison..both were flashy guys who were pretty good scorers and were headcases at times for their teams with similar first names.

Even their per 36 are very similar:

Stephon: 18.4 / 2.8 / 7.3 / 43.3 FG% / 32.5 3p% / 78.4 ft%

Steve: 17.4 / 5.4 / 5.8 / 42.9 FG% / 34.1 3p% / 79.7 ft% 

Not sure how you could really give the nod to one guy or the other."
"1628","Warriors","I never understood these 'because of lebron' arguments. I can very well say the warriors will win 'because of the splash bros'. Each team has 12 players they can play, and we speculate how those 12 players compare to win a game. "
"1629","Warriors","True, but if you compare stuff like offensive ranking, defensive ranking, pace, margin of victory, etc, the W's were significantly better than the Hawks."
"1630","Warriors","Why do people think that basketball is played 1 on 1? It's not Curry vs Lebron, it's Warriors vs Cavs. And the Warriors are far and away better than anyone the Cavs have played in the playoffs so far. If one player could carry a team to a title, maybe the Heat wouldn't have gotten blown the fuck out during the finals last year when Lebron was on a healthier team and was playing at a higher level."
"1631","Warriors","It's not defense vs offense. Warriors have the best defense in the NBA. They can win even when shots aren't falling. Oh and lol, maybe you should have just told Houston to guard our shooters?? Maybe then Curry wouldn't have gone 7/9 from deep"
"1632","Warriors","We also played uncharacteristically against the lakers. Thank god they're not in the playoffs. "
"1633","Warriors","I guess I read that wrong, when he said may see more of that, thought he was referring to putting Mozgov in rather than TT at the 5 which is why I was confused. "
"1634","Warriors","Based on...?"
"1635","Warriors","Actually more like, it's a brotherhood, stop diving into people's knees and doing cheap shit to provoke them."
"1636","Warriors","[Here's an even better response to why the warriors will win](http://warriorsworld.bayareaballllc1.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/8553127.jpg)"
"1637","Warriors","&gt;emotional lesbian

LOL what does that mean "
"1638","Warriors","No, I never compared the two. I was just pointing out that if regular season games meant anything in the playoffs,  the lakers will fuck us up. "
"1639","Warriors","Remember how the warriors had both he and Gilbert and then they both ended up on the warriors east in washington. Point of story he was amazing"
"1640","Warriors","Yup, and the FO has made it pretty clear they're committed to keeping the core together, even if it means going into luxury taxes."
"1641","Warriors","What the fuck are we going to do about this guy? It just hit me that if the dubs get to the finals, they're going to have to beat Lebron James."
"1642","Warriors","Andre is the same player,  he's just fit his mold. The warriors surviving the Memphis defense was enough to prove that when the warriors pass,  they're really hard to stop. If lebron is on steph, that opens up so many shots for all the 4 other players. No one can stop lebron,  just like no one can stop steph. That's what being asuperstar is about. Not sure where the notion of out rebounding draymond Comes from. Both are elite rebounders and Draymond is extremely quick now that he dropped 50 pounds. "
"1643","Warriors","What?"
"1644","Warriors","Sometimes I wonder why Lebron doesn't do this all the time. I just don't see how anyone can stop him save for a very few centers in this league."
"1645","Warriors","We were down 1-2 against a bigger,  stronger,  grittier,  and more experienced Memphis team. Coming back from that proved that we have elite mental fortitude. Steve Kerr's presence is also huge. Kawhi missing those shots can't just be attributed to pressure. He was never an elite free throw shooter. A team wouldn't be 67-15 with an all time great point differential and net differential if it was soft."
"1646","Warriors","How is elbowing a guy in the face going for the ball?"
"1647","Warriors","Westbrook is reading this. "
"1648","Warriors","FYI- Lebron won't be guarding Curry for more than a handful of possessions at a time. If he is, he's gonna get burned hard"
"1649","Warriors","Wait, I'm confused. Where was this kid in 3 out of the 5 finals that Lebron has ever played in???"
"1650","Warriors","I was listening to the pre-game on my local radio while I was driving out to watch the game, and the commentators were saying how Dwight and Josh Smith were throwing basketballs around at each other like they were footballs, including Dwight doing some back-of-the-endzone toe taps on the sidelines.

This, during pregame, in one of probably the 10 most important games of his career. He's pretending to play football instead of getting in the zone, staying game ready, focusing on the gameplan.

And now he's telling the FANS that all he saw was quit?"
"1651","Warriors","Yeah, or if he was 7 feet tall... but he's not."
"1652","Warriors","He averaged 3.9 over his career against 11.1 assists (2.8 a:to) and never more than 4.6. So not quite as bad as you say. 

But by comparison, John Stockton averaged 2.8 against 10.5 (3.8 a:to), never more than 3.8."
"1653","Warriors","There are tons of people who are Lakers/9ers fans in the South Bay, sadly. People who just couldn't resist rooting for the Kobe/Shaq Lakers growing up, while we were gifted with the Dunleavy, Troy Murphy, Adonal Foyle Warriors.  Some of us stuck through it, but there are a lot more Lakers fans than you'd think in the South Bay"
"1654","Warriors","I thought the obvious implication is that Dellededoba isn't in the brotherhood, thus doesn't get any consideration "
"1655","Warriors","Thing about Harden is that he doesn't hustle as much as the rest of these guys and he really gives up on defense when the Rockets start losing and/or when his chucks/flops aren't going his way. I suppose it's much worse for Harden because he had to deal with an injured howard/DM this year and so he kept getting exposed as lazy. If he had a coach as good as Kerr, Rockets would at least be able to hide him on someone not great at shooting. You see the same thing with Bron this year, where there's is less hustle than what we're used to seeing. I think Lebron's definitely earned the right to complain though and he's given his body a beating, so him resting up isn't as much a big deal. Harden's still young, but he gives little effort. I think Harden is going to have a very sharp dropoff once he gets older and he gets even more slower than he is. Coaches don't like someone who can't shoot and don't try on defense."
"1656","Warriors","Warriors and Lakers have been my favorite teams since birth. It's just how my household was. "
"1657","Warriors","Cavs, because I love it every time Dubs prove me wrong."
"1658","Warriors","But they also gotta make sure they hold Golden State to less points than the Rockets can score."
"1659","Warriors","True, drive by Teague was a good idea, but Scott should have kicked it out to Bazemore who was wide open in the corner. Three defenders in the paint, including a very good rim protector, does not equal easy lay-up.  "
"1660","Warriors","Woah... I just said LeBron like 10 times and suddenly his name sounds weird. Just think about his name. Le, Bron? The fuck kind of name is that?

Wiki article about this phenomenon: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation"
"1661","Warriors","Uh... let's not."
"1662","Warriors","Yeah, against a mismatch it's still not the worst shot he can take- and Kerr will allow it to happen out of a broken play. But he's also gotten a lot better at his footwork, and last year it was just bad."
"1663","Warriors","Woah woah woah.  ""Robbed"" is a little strong here.  Yeah, being a GSW fan, I think Kerr deserved the award, but so did Budenholzer.  Two very deserving coaches, and this was just Budenholzer's year."
"1664","Warriors","Yeah Today I really saw the player in him, while I don't like bashing but as a counter-example James Harden (though a great player and against a tough Dubs) seemed to have given by Game 3. After watching tonight I dont think LeBron would ever give up during the playoffs, which makes this Cavs team really scary to face."
"1665","Warriors","Double digits in three major statistical categories, most commonly points, rebounds, and assists. "
"1666","Warriors","i think its possible and im one of the most anti mark jackson ppl out there. kerrs done a fantastic job but i think hes had his greatest impact on those around steph (klay draymond barnes) rather than steph directly. weve seen mvp tendencies from steph before kerr like the series vs denver 2 years ago or when he had 54 at the garden etc"
"1667","Warriors","Yeah that's true.  If it were LeBron, they would find some dodgy accounts from drunk people who were there and lead Sportscenter with it, but I'm not sure all that tabloid-style attention would be a good thing for Thabo, who is (literally) the victim here.  

I bet there is no way NYPD let's this get to trial.  Thabo will get a $5M settlement or something, the police report will be inconclusive, and everyone will just try and make the whole thing go away.  "
"1668","Warriors","That's fair. Shawn Bradley, Michael Jordan, and Chuck Liddell are the only famous people I've met. Liddell and MJ didn't really interact. That's why I was happy Bradley actually carried a conversation. I think we can expect most famous people to be kind of rude. They deal with spotlight every day. "
"1669","Warriors","I think Horford is saying that bitch cunts like Delle-bitch-aren't part of the brotherhood"
"1670","Warriors","This is like that incident where Green goes for the ball but accidentally hits Conley's face when he called time out. "
"1671","Warriors","there's freak injuries and overuse/fatigue injuries. We've been lucky to not have one of those freak injuries this year (we had one last year w/ Bogut's ribs) But the point stands: the constant rest all season has certainly helped us not have the Kyrie or CP3-esque knee or hamstring injuries.

"
"1672","Warriors","exactly.. most east coast fan's have not seen Warriors go full on NBA2K 
Warriors have a deep.. deep team. Harrison Barnes is going Play-offs Barnes again. He's athletic and can shoot 3's ranked 21st in 3pt % in NBA. 
out of all top SF, Barnes is great at rebounds and FG%. GS back-up Center is no slouch. And with a 2nd unit that includes Shaun Livingston, Iggy, Klay, Ezeli, and Barbosa. 

Warriors in 6. Watching King James getting tired out by the 4th is no joke. "
"1673","Warriors","I'm curious who the 1% you think you can take are."
"1674","Warriors","Gotta love the juxtaposition of Lebron's face twisted in effort with Bazegod's calm glance of ""well gosh darn it, I think this one is out of my reach."""
"1675","Warriors","Ugh... I like his scrappy play too... I'm half convinced that he has intentionally gone after players knees this postseason..."
"1676","Warriors","Anybody else think that Mike Budenholzer has got some creepy ass eyes?"
"1677","Warriors","too drunk and lazy to run any kind of statistical significance test on this haha. but also curry was 91% or so FT shooter. When you shoot that high, each free throw miss would take off about 1.5% off his total since he's taken 75 whereas in the regular season when he's taken many many more each miss doesn't hurt nearly as much. not worried about either. especially not jesus curry"
"1678","Warriors","They all have COOL PERSONALIZED HANDSHAKES.  I really want to know how they get developed.  My hope is that it takes significant work, like bron and shump are just in a meeting room with a whiteboard thats almost entirely covered in math and crude drawings of hands with arrows going everywhere, arguing about whose thumb timing is off"
"1679","Warriors","A Pistons fan saying it? Cold."
"1680","Warriors","Personally I think its a bit of both. Delly ran into horford, horford didnt liek it and started to pull him down. Delly realized he was pulling him down and decided to just continue runnning into horford's knees. "
"1681","Warriors","I was thinking the exact same thing. I might understand that play if they were up 2-0."
"1682","Warriors","Gay's a better scorer than Klay?"
"1683","Warriors","My bad. I was just legitimately pissed watching those plays. He was diving at guys' knees. Not fucking cool. At all."
"1684","Warriors","Is 40 min supposed to show he's a hard worker now?"
"1685","Warriors","Great insight, excellent comment."
"1686","Warriors","Context Addifier Activated: ""So (venerated members of the sporting media,) what are we really (having a gentlemenly discussion and) talking about? (The earlier great sporting of) basketball games or those guys (,the Hawks players,) trying to figure out a way to (vengefully injure or drop The People's Elbow on) Matthew (""Delly"" Dellavedova),"" LeBron (GOAT at SF) James said."
"1687","Warriors","I agree with you but:

&gt;I mean Celts and Lakers won 8/10 titles in the 80s, if that doesn't show the lack of competitiveness in the rest of the league nothing will.

Lakers and Spurs won 7/10 championships in the 2000s, and 2 of the 5 championships in the 2010s so far so I don't think that is a great indicator of how competitive an era is."
"1688","Warriors","No way. Kawakami? Butthurt?? 

I don't believe you. "
"1689","Warriors","James Hardenesque"
"1690","Warriors","I started watching about 2 years ago when the Dubs were getting better. I grew up in Italy and I started college in Berkeley about 3 years ago so became a Bay Area fan. So yeah I dont remember that game. =D\

little edit*"
"1691","Warriors","Those Magic passes were beautiful."
"1692","Warriors","Does anyone remember Steve Francis?"
"1693","Warriors","All it would take is an injury to a star player. For example, if something were to happen and Lebron and Kyrie where both done for the series, the Hawks could easily win 4 in a row."
"1694","Warriors","Ok, then by that logic his rebounds aren't as impressive because 5 or 6 of his rebounds are missed tip ins."
"1695","Warriors","He grew up playing Australian Rules football which is much different to rugby. In Australian rules it is heavily frowned upon to take someone's legs out and you are taught to play with that in mind. "
"1696","Warriors","He's a pro athlete in the NBA, his body control is undoubtedly incredible but also, as you say, not Blake or LeBron's. The Hawk's seem convinced that he is going for their knees and it rattled Horford enough to do something stupid. So whether he is or isn't, he definitely got in their heads (KG style) which made a big impact in game 3!
Jason Kidd is another player who could get in opponents heads if you're into that and want to look up old highlights. He had several tricks including stepping on opponent's feet in transition!"
"1697","Warriors","I can see the headline now, ""Riley Curry missing Dellavedova prime suspect""."
"1698","Warriors","The Hawks are no where near healthy.

If they were, I doubt the Cavs would be leading 3-0."
"1699","Warriors","Yeah, I can still hear Breen's playcall in my head easily -- ""...won't go! ... rebound Bosh... back out to Allen... his 3 pointer... BANG!"" No time for a pump fake in there!"
"1700","Warriors","When the fuck did steph huck 35 shots up?"
"1701","Warriors","...have you not heard of Oceania? Where was your 5th grade teacher?"
"1702","Warriors","Utah is a team I really like for the next few years. Depends on if they're able to figure out their PG situation. Much depends on the development of Burke and Exum. Not sold on either yet. That being said, I love their defense, and Derrick Favors is one of the most underrated big men in the NBA. Quin Snyder comes from the Pop/Budenholzer coaching tree too."
"1703","Warriors","Then you probably ain't that good "
"1704","Warriors","Anyone have a link to the Inside the NBA stuff for this game? Everybody is talking about it on here but I can't find it anywhere

Edit: [Found one](http://www.nba.com/video/channels/tnt_overtime/2015/05/25/20150524-inside-matthew-dellavedova.nba/). Btw, the NBA's video player is somehow even worse than the NFL's, who the fuck told all these organizations to make their own video player by paying some Estonian contractor on oDesk or some shit. That video took me literally 10 minutes to load, with no indication that anything was happening during that time, and I have pretty good internet. Plus once it starts it skips back and forth "
"1705","Warriors","Power Point Shooting Center Forward"
"1706","Warriors","If anyone from this year's West misses the playoffs next season it's Dallas or New Orleans. Dallas is definitely on the decline and I just don't think the Pels can surround AD with enough no matter how insane he may be next year. That being said, I think Karl's going to have to change that stat to 20/22 on his resume because the Kings aint going anywhere sad to say. You forget there's still teams that are going to get a lot better like OKC, PHX, and my sleeper pick Utah (but i think Utah's probably a year away)"
"1707","Warriors","If it's any consolation, I got the joke..."
"1708","Warriors","I'm on the fence as to whether Delly was looking for an opportunistic dirty play but that in no way influenced my opinion on Horford. Ejection was the easy call. I've seen that agreement even from the full blown Delly=Hitler comments"
"1709","Warriors","I worry about their ability to get scoring from the point guard position. Exum can't shoot and good NBA defenses are realizing they can just back off and dare these guards to shoot like the Dubs did with Tony Allen or the entire world has done with Rondo. In today's league your PG needs to be able to hit a jumper with some confidence. That's what makes Wall's development this season so impressive. "
"1710","Warriors","Ya, if you had a team made up of five Lebrons you would fucking destroy everybody. Five Currys probably wouldn't work so well"
"1711","Warriors","LeBron brought his videogame for this one. What a performance. "
"1712","Warriors","I often feel that way with Curry's 3pt shooting, but with Lebron it's like every aspect of the game"
"1713","Warriors","He has half the Niners fanbase blocked after the whole Harbaugh thing"
"1714","Warriors","No it wont"
"1715","Warriors","Not enough Spirit in St. Louis for an NBA team"
"1716","Warriors","Can't really blame him for defending himself and his teammates. At least he owned up to it."
"1717","Warriors","It will go right down in history with all those other post-game non-clinching, non-finals posters we all own and love."
"1718","Warriors","lebron is under .500 in the NBA finals"
"1719","Warriors","I don't think that's the point. The way I read it, what bothers people (and it bothers me too) is that he pretends to be modest. Nobody expects him to be modest, he's very clearly one of the greatest players of all time. But he has a whole shtick of acting all humble and shit when he really isn't."
"1720","Warriors","Hawks in 7 and Dennis Schroeder's gold stripe in his hair gets MVP. This would be a great series though in another round though (if they played in the same conference)"
"1721","Warriors","I mean, yeah. I don't fault him for that reaction, winning games is always exhilarating. But an iconic Lebron photo? Hell no."
"1722","Warriors","[Relevant Key and Peele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogUTMs5Z3ko)."
"1723","Warriors","It's a great compliment to Delly's ability to get under opponent's skin. He was able to get the level headed Horford do something that likely cost the Hawks game 3.
Edit: for clarity."
"1724","Warriors","you're in pure denial if you truly believe Dellavedova didn't have any other alternative motive in that fall..."
"1725","Warriors","Not to disagree with the point you're trying to make, but theres this guy named draymond, not everyone loves him."
"1726","Warriors","I mean, of course, because then we would be championship. LeBron could drop quintuple doubles every day and as long as we won it I wouldn't give a shit, it'd probably make it even better."
"1727","Warriors","He's an Aussie like Bogut and Baynes.  They play tough and don't take shit from anybody.  "
"1728","Warriors","thanks for looking that up, thats awesome!"
"1729","Warriors","Sherman eating that turkey leg was fucking hilarious"
"1730","Warriors","double nickel is his 55 point game just a few games after returning from his sabbatical
"
"1731","Warriors","I don't think ""dirty"" is the right word here. Maybe reckless is a better way to describe it. Like Kenny said, if he did things like this once or twice in the playoffs, it might be a fluke. It's harder to believe when it happens again. "

"1746","Warriors","...man, okay, so I'm big into competitive Dota 2, right? And I thought it was rough on the players of THAT game not having parents that understand that they can make a living off of that. (Last year's season-ending invitational tournament, referred to as ""The International"", had a combined prizepool of $10,930,698, with first prize taking home $5,028,121, split between five players. Yes, that's right, last year's winners became instant millionaires for playing a video game.)

To hear that even widely accepted sports leagues still have parents who feel this way makes me sit back and try to wrap my head around how far back your mindset has to be if you can't even accept your kid making a living once they've already hit the big leagues AND are in the playoffs, AND are on the cusp of making the finals."
"1747","Warriors","He should get his dick cut off for that one."
"1748","Warriors","If he gets fouled he just has another opportunity to embarrass himself at the line. Great player, but like Jordan and Howard he has a huge hole in his game."
"1749","Warriors","Yeah, I mean, that's life right? The good teams attract shitty fans. So do the bad teams. Lots of humans are shitty and lots of humans are NBA fans, so that's gonna intersect eventually.

There are more assholes than ever on /r/warriors, more classy white knights, more ""HEY, GRIZZBROS GOOD GAME"" type of shit than ever. I don't like it but it comes with this type of playoff run. Try to separate the fans from the team though. There are shitty people everywhere."
"1750","Warriors","He'd probably drop an elbow on his head, or at least try."
"1751","Warriors","Did Dellavedova admit that he leg locked Taj?"
"1752","Warriors","Am i the only one who doesn't believe this is a poster? It's a great dunk, but a poster to me is body to body. "
"1753","Warriors","It sounds like you're giving him the benefit of the doubt. As far as we know, these are 3 separate instances when he managed to be over aggressive. The argument can be made that he didn't intend for 2 out of the 3 to happen. Like I said, I don't think he's a dirty player. But even then, arguments can be made against him. Therein lies my point, he's involved in these altercations too often to be given the benefit of the doubt. Sorry Delly, it's time to play ball. This nonsense isn't necessary. "
"1754","Warriors","Why are warrior fans salty? a lot of us are huge lebron fans, i was pumped up this game"

"1756","Warriors","the NBA and the media?"
"1757","Warriors","Totally agree. I get why players feel the need to hide the competitive nature of the game, but I wish they wouldn't. I wanna see and hear trash talk, guys getting in each others' faces and instigating shit. I'd much rather listen to Lebron or Steph taunting their opponents than JVG and Mark Jackson slobbering over each other's dicks."
